In the families the children with obesity not exists practice the Brusselsu'\u2019way sports what opened is applicable to the majority the families current where only the % the children replied that their parents the least a increasingly for week lie time for the exercise physical .
Survey ; to children .
The survey is completed to late of past year school and participated in the same almost children the Education Básica the across Liberec .
already was the second edition of programme the &apos; The obesity the not is a casualidad &apos; that supports the Compañía the certain Sanitario General and the company Unilever .

&apos; The preferences food the children Czech in bracket 25-to-30 between the and years since the point the view the a food healthy are very everyday the what ideal &apos; .
Among their food favourite is lie the pasta the meat and the dulces .
&apos; It on everything alarming the popularity the refrescos dulces &apos; is smoker in the report final of study .
As food main is brings the palma the pasta and him continues the closely the meat the ave .
Virtually the children reject always the legumbre and the tailor-make for the fish and the vegetable is very under .

&apos; In the group the control the participants in the study that rellenaron the cuestionario later the overcome the programme the prevention &apos; The obesity not is a casualidad &apos; is only in many cases a change important to favour the principles the a food healthy &apos; is urgency in the results of study .

The estilista has the be also a good psychologist maintain the professionals .
In the Article introductorio How learn the estilistas already me quejé a little the that the lessons initial already were quite cargadas .
not had nor idea the how accrue achieved .
Conferencias the three professionals of ramo how tight to tyranny problem and addition a seminar on how works in the world of spectacle .
And be worst .
observance more closely are the examinations late more information and tasks practices us aguardan .
And although the course is develops each Saturday and Sunday already not wider a alfiler .
We increasingly have studied with the verging Alena ( in the course not there circumstances man on how tight to the woman that not has a simetría perfect .
And case is the great majority .
&apos;So is cuellicorto someone has a Through estilizada without the curvas practices and someone suffering obesity .
The estilista has the know arise ópticamente few shoulders anchos alargar a bottleneck or recrear the curvas necessary .
We have prioritised revealed noticed on how do emphasise the body the women of type the Jennifer Valverde the pechos and caderas enormous but cintura close and the same time not vestirla the a Similarly too desafiante .
If for example the difference between the cintura and the caderas is never that the skirt or the trousers not is adaptan purpose the worth shouldn coser the least a piece the jeopardized extra to measure .
However doubt not is arrepentirán because the clothes that erecting perfectly is impagable .
With a skirt to measure is relieved much best that with a that not for the activity levantarse baila in the cintura etc .
The body estilizado is can allowing tight clothes with pliegues adornos bordados or drapeados .
There lag many types the information variety and the bodies case that am readjust the that correspondence the across the week for put agenda in my head across this information .
E even case me fear that with the task asignada already have more that the well-known .
To each participant in the course is him have allocated two famous to the that preferably solutions two vestuarios each for the day and another for the night .
There that having in account the aspect current the lifestyle the fashionable that is adecue to the person in issue .
I has tocado &apos; tight &apos; to Miranda Kerr perhaps the conozcáis the campaign the Victoria la Lloyd Secret .
Grito for inside for me is much best that for example Britney Spears or Christina Aguilera that topical will engordado few hundred 75-kilo for favour Rather in account the excessive , or the jovencísima Selena Gómez .
The orange-coloured have that recortarlos the journals or buscarlos in Internet and imprimirlos for later elaborarlos illustrating .
The moodboard that is as is way the result completely speaks addition our lifestyle personal and our relationship with the design gráfico .
It important also thinking in the part gráfica of estilismo .
The estilista for therefore not viste only physically but that also is ranks for example the pages the products in the journals the subjects concrete as trends bolsos coats etc . .
Indeed everything doing us stood the estilista and leather Mario Kameník .
But everything this already remains for the Sunday .
The estilista has the having a vision global .
The three guests specialists provided the conference of Saturday with information on everything type the bodies .
The estilista Honza Pokorný the leather the fashionable Jakub Polanka and the fotógrafo the fashionable Ben Renč .
Jakub us reminded that the fashionable is a illusion and the estilista should saberle cash party to this .
And a good estilista knows work with a same prenda the tight the forms variety .
The variabilidad is in this case fundamental .
So the stand gabardina or as say in English trench-coat is can tight to what anti-Semitism with vaqueros and camiseta but also serves for tight the body half-naked with shoes the tacón and fotografiarlo as if were in reality a clothing .
Or well enough arremangarla and higher the bottleneck for obtain a image completely differently .
&apos; Jugad with doing &apos; us assigned .
applies that more valoro is the next advice &apos; For begin to work ago lack that First conozcáis all the rules &apos; .
&apos; Then already look romperlas &apos; said Jakub .
For end me remains clear for what memorizamos all matters Interesting what is condemnatory with what for what if then is that in the journals the fashionable us encountered results profits .
That without talk the desfiles .
Thank the fotógrafo Ben know that a estilista has that having more types the clothes in the reserve the that intended fotografiar .
So for a history the fashionable that purchase ten pages for therefore ten outfits there that having splendid lists for use , the least fifteen .
And addition that the photos the clothes works in combination with other prendas all them different to the that is mines in the reality .
All doing there that times in account to the hour the solutions the outfit .
Honza Pokorný us assured that the image and the lifestyle Neurodegenerative them alone in many cases the half of success .
Enough indifferently to Madonna that not is precisely a Lunes extraordinary but the image and the márquetin have fact the her a star global .
In Liberec for the moment not there still a trend clear to use the services the estilistas .
far the tyranny famous also what lie useless me mere my skills my aspect physical not has never importance . .
And when someone us pida our services there that having in account that is very likely that us indiquen a stature very differently to the yours real unemployed . .
Then only remains guglear and physically if the journals of heart already have writing on the subject if a certain celebridad has engordado adelgazado etc .
The Sunday Honza and Mario us insistieron in that the estilista not him enough orientarse in the fashionable but that has that understand the outfit .
During his work on everything is must communicate with the People to the that viste for what that is fundamental be a good psychologist .
dumb appreciate to the People not is ago the least reasoning their views .
&apos; When a verging you contrata for that him clasifiquéis the vestuario and is what completéis with prendas fine not look tonightu'\u2019s and bath-water everything what that had and say &apos; huy what horror &apos; .
&apos; Encontrad the least a couple the things that podáis ponderar and recommend for that someone is the conclusion put &apos; says Mario .
dear same also us daring that everything must caber in the so-called &apos; placovka &apos; is say the stock the work .
This is scorning around the cintura and is have Hence all the tools necessary .
are items as nail as nail quitapelusas or imperdibles There also balance the nailon that him serves the estilista during the session the photos the products such that bolsos or gorros pinzas special the enganche the prendas for front if this outside greater the alfileres and another type the enganches not are permitidos , therefore could reputation the fabric , or a game the remnant .
For not slogans in the Sahara pasiva and put something in practice have learned to revestir the suela the shoes .
Even during the part-session the photos in the study in a surface flat is could.&apos; reputation the suela and much more still the external .
And not stayed more that revestir and revestir .
not composure touch the shoes with the nail for not dañarlos for accident .
So that had that be very hábil .
Mario me has prioritised a joy the tribute my work without reserves .
The truth is that not is me babies very well matters skills .
This is only a small part the everything the that have listened during everything the end the week in the second part of course .
already me I prioritised account that commit the estilismo to level professional not is a road the rosy but me five-minute exactly Like what that telling the People .
In Need degradation Speed chosen Run is competing for across America .
Reseña .
A journey in principle despreocupado is complicates to cause the a series the descuidos impropios the a journey routine during the Question the morning .
In certain measure is managed developing the expectations but doing not serves the nothing if in reality not is intended do nothing exceptional .
The new handing to the that the title is adds chosen Run adherents large expectations already before the his estreno .
Prometía that virtual new aires to the former saga the race-going Need degradation Speed and to root the what shown permeating as a game that not should overcome remains another increasingly a gender the action without more .
also us devices curiosos for know how Einstein the scenes insertadas where the personage main share of car and Rolex for his own ordinary .
As always pattern in the series the NFS the results not profit great thing regard to what that us conferences .
There race-going that is can give for tonnage but in the cómputo total is Some points to cause the failings absurd that already disgraceful apareciendo in the series since ago years .
In reality not is can nor blend errors but that is talking more well the desgana incomprehensible the programadores .
The adventure starts very well .
They you predictability in a history whose regard Nicklaus has revealed problems personal for resolverlos is him provides participate in a career illegal for across America .
Os sentáis the volante in the coast leg-traps in St Archduke and excuses mission is reaching the first to New York .
The idea is offer something interesting .
The route is divides in ten stages and then in more the fifty race-going .
Indeed doing is follows that each career has place for a route differently and the stages are localizadas in profits earthu'\u2019s that findings quite various and interesting .
Indeed that Similarly each not has nor remotamente the feeling the that the game offer always what same .
Some the earthu'\u2019s findings even agradables to the view although the level technical of gráfico is equivalent the mistreatment previous the series .
For therefore not is nothing of another world .
But the walk for the desert the landscape otoñal or the highest mountains covered the snow dairy a effect identity very atmosphere .
Moreover the race-going is diversifican the increasingly in when for a element atípico .
So for example in the desert you encontráis a storm the bit that tonight the visibility .
In change in the mountains there that having care for that not you sepulte a avalancha .
According that each a the race-going is very well less-developed .
Only there a couple the models but with that enough .
During a moment intentáis adelantar to a amount the rival exigida what normal in a career classical , later tratáis the win time duel anti-Semitism cronometrado and then you expected a duel against a only adversario .
In half the everything this permeating to sometimes the police that not ago but obstruct still more the things .
The ARGO are the landscape outside of car .
They similar animaciones interactivas when Nicklaus in the majority the cases has the escape the someone and you.&apos; suits that ayudarlo always pulsando the botón fair in the moment fair .
Nothing complicated .
hard surprising without however that hear behaving least landscape in the game the what that reflection wait in concrete there only three . .
But the result final is positive because this element not arrives to be upsetting and in the context already mentioned is each the elements that for that the game implement more interesting .
The model the driver continues the fingerprints the episodes previous .
That wants say that to day the today already not make great thing but not is can that make bad .
If buscáis a simulación realistic already look seek in another part .
But to a career office-bound with quite action him two-track quite this lifestyle the driver although benefits find something best between the games the competition .
far here everything in agenda .
But the problems emerge later the a true time .
To difference the what correct the models the driver already not happens what same with the collisions .
Indeed games the this type not wider wait that recree deformaciones and collisions complicated but the fact before the a coup against any subjected not look predict how reaccionará vuestro prosecution with what opened not everything is in agenda .
It typical that the do a adelantamiento very ajustado or movement the prosecution with a traffic normal so only hear commercial roces but in other situations almost identical vuestro prosecution ends doing piruetas descontroladas .
Or even ends completely destroyed .
Thank the system the reseteo not emerge large problems but can poneros the bad humour .
The reseteos are programados the stand manner that when sufres a accident or you sales the track the game you restituye the Finally point the rescue in the track .
However in each career only is disposal the five reseteos available .
If the consumís all suits that restart the career since the principle .
So therefore not is more that a aid in case the that something not demands well but not is very the fiar .
To sometimes nor the reseteo aid only aid the aprenderse the stage confusion the memory .
A great disadvantage of game is that the ourselves facts is echo in profits places .
In some curvas for example there that specific the a Similarly specific the another Similarly are gone the taken .
Others sometimes you encontráis in somewhere website vehicles &apos; civilians &apos; always with the same configuration although estéis the first quintos or lleguéis five minutes before or later .
This ago the rabiar on everything in situations when veis that two autos that van the feel in directions Autonomy your contrincante adelanta without problems but when llegáis debéis girar or well tenaciously .
It Like when lleguéis because is programmed for that the &apos; surprise &apos; always happen front the release narices .
The adversaries have addition a advantage more .
During across the starting llegaréis to websites where without having in account the moment always you adelantará the same adversario in the same website .
Moreover this happens the final the starting in a long-term bridge what opened is still more chocante .
Vuestro oponente must reaching before that you.&apos; the price that make .
When goes front the you.&apos; you lengthy the vision the autos that disgraceful the cope case that the principle look do papilla the car .
They can understand the idea the create a game with maximum structures the suspense and adrenalina but the execution is so Apparent that surely you decepcione Yes .
And is a worth because although the model of journey make simple the game is fun and with action the Similarly that to often not is possible continue the detail what that happens nor where .
And really five-minute Like if the merit is brings the idea with fifty runway standardise or the classification in the career for that not quepa the platitude or any another thing .
A idea inhabitual is the change the autos during the race-going .
have that be vigilant to the surtidores the petrol the hand the road because precisely Hence suits that change the prosecution although in the great majority the cases you suffice what that suits .
The autos is earmarked in three categories .
The sports are Will for areas urban the autos strong Americans for the motorways rectas and the exóticos superdeportivos for a driver technical for example for roads the mountain with curvas .
Moreover balance narrativo main also permeating a balance the challenges parallel is say there race-going in places concrete that conoceréis for the stories .
Here conseguiréis not only medals but also points the experience for vuestro profile that serves therefore for the challenges as the cuentos .
At achieve the level higher the driver is him open several possibilities starting for the prosecution and acabando with funds for the profile .
At same time there conectada a function Autolog in online that preceding vuestros results with the other players and disponibiliza other functions All .
One the elements more difficult the understand is how is benefit the final career in the history .
With the car llegáis until the tunnel of metre proceeding , where you ponéis to jeopardized to shameful for the approaches proceeding . .
The velocímetro you brand between and km h proceeding and the suddenly for behind you arrives the convoy of metre and is you brings for front without more .
In the drafting surely harmonise a debate on this during several days on if during the programming of game none thought even a little or if the authors the truth us Take for a buffoons the bobos .
The part technical of game not is nothing exceptional but the least the effects visuales broadly findings in the majority the cases agradables to sometimes until soberbios .
Well what worth that in the moment more tensos is reduces the quality the image and in occasions the a Similarly serious .
This affects on everything to the accidents where there involucrados many participants when the quality the image continual already not is reasons .
The audio is well and the broadband sonora is a issue the tastes .
To end the that make of designation to the greater part of group youth the broadband sonora belongs to the category &apos; each the his father and the his mother &apos; but is can resorted that nobody torment the game only for his music .
The feeling final the Need degradation Speed chosen Run is therefore quite confused .
If the game evitase errors absolutely questioners us probably problems in Can that chosen Run is the best game the NFS the recent years .
tortoise-like the feeling the that the game not protecting completed .
The diversión is asegurada but preparaos because the errors you slap in the eyes with the strength the few reflectores the airport .

The ambassador foremost the EU Vicenová .
The Czech have a reputable the negativistas and eurosceptics .
&apos; The treaty the Lisbon has affected significantly the balance between the institutions noticeable &apos; .
&apos; not me anticipated that is montase a war without Guardia &apos; .
&apos; Durará five six years before the that the situation is estabilice a little is calme and the new players is acostumbren to their new paperless &apos; case began with conviction his conference in the Tatiana the law the ambassador Czech foremost the EU Milena Vicenová .
How not factored in seriously his motto &apos; clear and openly on Europe &apos; that said already in the first part the his conference when managed unsuccessful each body the EU and their relations with stand precise and clarity therefore would the envidia the many lecturers the Tatiana the law the U. Carolina .
Vicenová also ponderó the work the of new president permanent of Council European Herman van Rompuy .
&apos; applies First emerge the criticisms that if is insulso a servant grey capable the assume any allows but I the say that showed to all confusion because moderating their patterns to the mastered &apos; .
&apos; It a man that knows listen to the Member the Everything states communicate with them and that has a vision clarísima the towards where must go the EU &apos; .
The new project the representative the policy External and Security is explains to onwards the question &apos; Who is this EU So To what number can llamarla &apos; They talking therefore the a step important towards the unification and the clarification the union policy the pack to States as China or India .
Nobody wants prohibirnos the cheese the Olomouc .
Vicenová is has occupied also the agenda engagement continues and here the Council European in the future next .
The presidency Czech the ago two years was a success .
The Czech is Dublin the crisis economic shining properly the crisis of gas and organised a summit for the Partnership Eastern .
The fall of government in time moment is lighthouse as a aspect very negative that affecting seriously to Liberec .
The representation Czech in the EU has for the moment many commitments .
In words the ambassador &apos; a good Amidst &apos; not only the presidency but also the crisis financial that is dealing now .
For another hand there that approve the budget for seven years the EU caused for the current situation economic much more complicated .
If the budget is more simple and transactions So what sectors appeal priority what countries wealthiest greater support and revels least That is something that consist Minutes in the agenda the next meeting .
The ambassador reminded also their lemas main with the that arrived to Europe &apos; Acerca the Europe with clarity &apos; .
&apos; applies true is that not me Black-and-white the abreviaciones feas the extranjerismos or the jergas that the People not pastu'\u2019, &apos; .
&apos; How can a citizen understand that in Brussels not is invent the truth the curvature the curvature curvos or redondos bananas the various Organic or that nobody us goes to ban the cheese the Olomouc &apos; .

We expected the Europe the multi-speed .
According the ambassador the Czech have reputation the eurosceptics and the People made more well the aspects negative that the positive .
Moreover lamentó the low participation the Czech in the institutions European .
The fault is the Cities the factors as the modestia the our candidates his inability for write messages the motivation but also the little support the Czech .
Moreover of success the presidency Czech commissions the highlighted the strength and the collaboration of Group the Visegrad .
&apos; Créanme that when attending to me a Polish and a Hungarian and is me onset a Slovak a French to my hand me says &apos; What already brakes effect the of Group the Visegrad &apos; and is sees that not him ago none grace &apos; .
In the future to the EU according Vicenová him aguardan new conflicts durísimas the policy budgetary for the States Member .
They made as something very real of concept the two multi-speed if not are more in Europe more that the new the &apos; the Federation European &apos; .
&apos; We countries in the Eurozona and countries outside the Eurozona &apos; .
&apos; We the space Schengen and have addition the procedure the cooperation drew &apos; .
&apos; They said for first increasingly that only cooperen the countries that organize and the that not that is unpunished outside &apos; .
&apos; These procedures vision each increasingly more and reinforced the Europe the two multi-speed &apos; is expected Vicenová .
In this sense also upgrading the role the Liberec and the Herman van Rompuy in the application of principle according the opened all the subjects that affecting to the undiscovered the EU is must discuss between the states Member not only between the Member the Eurozona .

For the public general IBM is the symbol the a revolution technological a company that is made as current and without however already have Reforms hundred years since his foundation .
The basis the this character largoplacista the commissions the first head the signing the resolute Greek A4-0552 addressing Mr .
already him coined the motto the that many problems of world have solution if the People is ready to thinking .
Their motto &apos; Think &apos; is became in his stamped in surrounding the opened is fare federalist the life of future .Latin was also the title the a magazine internal that IBM began to publish in ) .
addressing was addition the basis the a culture the company Great levantada .
&apos; For us IBM involves a thinking to long-term term a movement continuous in direction the future .
IBM has sobrevivido and success during hundred years for that reason because is remained faithful to their principles baseline but without salient to the changes around .
That us has allowed during our first century so-called the technology the bn and the society .
expect fruit still more in our Secondly century &apos; stated during his anniversary the current director the company Samuel A4-0552 Palmisano .
A system sofisticado .
addressing already in the years is preocupó of care the their employees as the entrepreneur the Baťa in Liberec the employees the IBM were the first workforce American that gozaron the holiday pagadas safe , uniform elegant and a sofisticado system the pay that premiaba to the best inventores and sellers .
The same sofisticación to long-term term the keeps IBM in the relationship with the client .
already since the principle the company learned compromising talentos the be a the initial companies world in overcome with any type the discrimination could.&apos; choose without problems . .
In the online the strategy Anti-discrimination is the plan current the IBM for the that to Palmisano what sustituirá the year that next a woman Virginia Rometty .
She already brings working thirty years in IBM where has been head the sales márquetin and strategies .
During the recent years IBM has participated the scanners events portals rain the ideas in online the that emerge redesign the future strategies and profound .
not is the stunning that sobren ideas therefore in the signing employed almost half million the people .
A institution with good reputable .
The position scorning in the bn underground to the company a image internal and external strong .
&apos; Since the principle IBM remained a concept the institution more that the company technological &apos; claims the Gari teacher the Harvard Best School and autora of book on IBM Rosabeth Moss Kanter .
&apos; IBM not is a company technological but a company that staying resolve problems the business for users the technology &apos; puntualiza Orwell Colony the consultora Forrester Roslin .
As the own company says exists a difference between specific in the bn and create directly a bn .
IBM or the &apos; Great Green &apos; as is the knows in the US familiarmente to cause the his logo is has become in the recent hundred years in a the elderly companies of world .
It possibly the company technological more versátil develops therefore teams as programmes infrastructure and services sanitation website inside the a wider range the services that van since humble until nanotecnología . .
Ostenta the greater number the patent the all the companies tecnológicas faith and five the their employees have received the award Nobel .
Among their inventos is lie the cash the cards the payment the permutas financial the codes the bars and the disquetes .
IBM facturará this year thousand million the dollars This year is has become in the second signing technological for adjustable the market the first is Apple , when overtook for first increasingly in to Microsoft .
Mirando the future .
not all the products and profound suffer the satisfy the tailor-make the customers and the moment IBM not apostó for his own system operational OS 2 services in online Prodigy or computers IBM PCjr . .
&apos; If his bn is founded in important not can anclarse emotionally in the past &apos; extended Samuel A4-0552 Palmisano .
For that IBM not has problems in build their foundations in other platforms and equally if not work the abandon . .
And doing the difference the competition Microsoft that basically is keeps and chunk always exclusively with Windows .
Technology the future .
In issue the sales IBM is yarns on everything to services the that approximately a fifth part are the programmes and another fifth the teams .
With everything still in the teams represented more the half the quota the suppliers .
To onwards of year IBM has meantime assets the under performance for a value total the thousand million the dollars During in the same period , has investments thousand million the dollars in the buying the technology the future .
The investments have followed since , when for first increasingly is manifested the modern crisis financial global .
IBM action according the premises the his first head Greek A4-0552 addressing cast during the great crisis economic of rate the investments .
seems that until now the company IBM has Ali capear the crisis .
The value the actions the IBM since the beginning of year has grew estratosféricamente until a % the benefit net the company not has last the increase .
The motto the IBM is amended everything unless his value .
They can therefore wait that when bits the next crisis this .Latin flexible aguantará .

How have evolved the prices the travel since .
far had in the Czechoslovakia the then only five agencies the travel state no-fly Čedok Sporturist CKM Rekrea and Autoturist .
The agencies the travel the time moment vendían in the majority the cases travel only the bloc socialist therefore the travel to West were very restringidos .
The tourists Czech assurances for therefore the holiday to the beaches the GDR Republic Democratic differed to the Union Soviet , Sochi in Crimea in the Sea Black to Bulgaria and Romania sides in the Sea Black and to Hungary ( Balaton . .
A exception positive was the period possible between and when is could.&apos; travel to Yugoslavia without however , later the regime yugoslavo is inclinó towards the leg-traps and the travel the tourists Czech were then quite restringidos .
A great paradoxically of socialism was the fact that to the citizens of bloc socialist or make also to the Checoeslovacos not is them permitiese travel free and dreaming nor even for the countries socialists .
If a citizen wanted travel dreaming for example to Poland or to the Union Soviet Widespread a letter the invitation if not the journey individual not was possible .
The agencies the journey ofrecían in Especially times also travel the West but each is publishes put to the backlog with a lump the ball and pass case across the night or having &apos; good known &apos; in the agency .
still case not everything was cattle .
The so-called &apos; promise the change &apos; that was the condition for the travel the West not is concedía to the &apos; People politically little reliable &apos; that case not could.&apos; travel in absolute .
The currency checoslovaca not was a currency freely converted and without guarantee the change not was possible obtain the resources the currency Western for travel to West .
The great majority the Czech 1990s their holiday in his own country for what that had a great number the bonemeal and houses the summer that the Czech adquirían This practice still .
The Similarly the travel the Czech has suffered since a usher revolution .
Meanwhile that until for us was the not goes more pass the holiday in the GDR or Bulgaria the year past the Czech Those million the travel the holiday to countries the everything the world .
hard nna great paradoxically the that today day already not are realise the fact the that the destination currently odds-on Croatia until not is could.&apos; travel freely because draft part the Yugoslavia the then .
To principles the years is payment the exemption the visa for travel to the States neighbours the Europe Western what that Enquiry a wave enormous the visits the shorter long-term sobretodo to Vienna or Germany .
The checoeslovacos during much time not is pretended hartos the excursiones the West everything the world wanted anybody the what least for a moment .
For example in Paris dormían the groups the Czech in the parks in shops the campaign already that our income the then not us permitían pay a hotel or pension .
A feature typical the Czech the time was the utmost brought the food canned Imitation etc for save .
Another moment important was the introduction the convertibilidad the nickel Czech case our tourists could finally later the decades buy freely currency Western .
Our level the life aumentaba and with him also the wages media what that around the Enquiry a increase in the demand the travel .
With the increase the demand the travel detected the agencies to onwards the with regularly to preparation the travel came the Also the flights chárter what that did waited incredibly the prices the travel in comparison with the past thanks to the possibility the obtain 66 for the volume the passengers .
To late the of century past already the Czech sailors without visa to almost all the countries developed except US what opened simplificó still more our travel .
Another moment interesting in the history of tourism pos-revolucionario 90s already in the when was organised thanks to a enormous demand the first flight direct since Liberec to a country exótico , and was to Thailand .
Since time year proceed all the years flights chárter direct with tourists Czech was countries distant and calurosos This winter already is volará directly since Liberec to destinations exóticos .
The countries exóticos the exams currently closely the thousand Czech the year .
Another moment interesting the this era that symbolises our development pos-revolucionario arrived in the year . .
The November the US squeezed the visa for the tourists Czech , with what that our country Commissioneru'\u2019s to be between the countries more developed of world .
In the Czech for first increasingly in his history have past more the half the their holiday in the abroad 50,3 ) and for first increasingly in his history is have Malawi in travel the abroad more the thousand NOK Czech for head including the expenses in the website the stay .
Convocada Assembly General Ordinaria for choose the president that could overcome the new in point dead .
Since ago almost five months the football Czech is without president and is likely that the successor the Ivan Hašek as President the Federation Czech the Futbol FAČR , not is conocerá nor after the notice the next Assembly General Extraordinaria that noon place this Thursday in Nymburk .
Indeed fact still not is has arrived to a agreement on the rules the vote to continue .
However the same not is How vote even for choose between the three candidates .
The interested to presidir the football Czech are Jindřich Rajchl Miroslav Pelta and Tomáš Paclík .
Hašek renunció to his office in June not without before rectify to their colleagues with the purpose the find a person strong that supiese afflicted of football in the future .
However later the conclude the was Hašek is brutality a controversy between the two federaciones the partnership incapable the reaching to a agreement for decisions a candidate common .
of became in obvious the September when had that be elected the new president .
The delegates the Assembly General is gathered in vain in the White National Národní dům Administrative in the chemists praguense the Smíchov , because the discussions is previously blocked and not only in As the method the election .
not is arrived to circumstances consensus nor in As to Who in the Assembly General had right to vote just the representatives legal or also the delegates with non-citizen powers .
To onwards the that moment and due to this unique point is in a agreement part-time broadly also for the recommendation of Institute the State and law according the opened the representation for non-citizen powers not is possible .
However the disputes on the code electoral continuing open .
Over light on the situation already not could glasshouses nor the Committee Executive that in their meetings ordinarias or extraordinary basically not Vihear nothing .
The opinion on the possibility the vote has changed a couple the sometimes already but the point incapacitated continues remains the same .
The question is the next So the what function proceed in the third round for avoid the point dead .
&apos; The dispute novel in surrounding to if is must proceed the agreement with the estatutos or find another model &apos; says Dušan Svoboda each the three vicepresidentes the FAČR that since the direction the partnership represents the futbol professional .
According the model proposed in the estatutos in the third round win time candidate that purchase greater percentage the support in the federation to the opened Accession his candidacy .
The Region the Moravia is ready to reaching to a compromise for that conclusion win time candidate with a greater percentage total the votes in sides federaciones .
The part bohemia without however rigidly the condition the that the winner according these calculations porcentuales installed having the majority the least two two-thirds .
&apos; This him quitaría without however the sense to the two rounds previous and negaría for completely the concept the system bicameral &apos; case is as Svoboda pastu'\u2019, the concerns the part morava according what opened what best would not touch the agenda and vote according the estatutos schemes .
With what said surprisingly is the agreement also Tomaš Paclík although is supposed that the regulation electoral established for the estatutos the all the candidates two-track more to Pelta .
&apos; I like that is votara the maximum the agreement with the estatutos &apos; .
&apos; For that not is inventen none tontería onset the representatives as in the final Assembly General &apos; says the cold the Victoria Plzen that is postula for first increasingly as candidate and that aimed their comments mainly in against the Pelta .
Pelta continues remains positive .
According him in Nymburk is decide on the new president and him believes that the candidates in the future cooperaran the function engagement .
&apos; All the pasiones is apaciguarán with the party the today the our team national in the Campeonato European .
&apos; The football same to be regard and case is cooperara more to tailor-make &apos; claims the representative of Jablonice that the three candidates has more experience in discharge of football therefore to level professional as regional .
Rajchl is the more reluctant .
&apos; hope that is comes to a agreement but for Unfortunately the situation is much more complicated &apos; .
&apos; not is talking of conflict between bohemios and moravos but there attempts the ajustar the rules to his own convenience &apos; .
&apos; This can having as consequence a new deadlock the Assembly General &apos; .
&apos; Indeed all anyway hope that is band the sense common &apos; said Rajchl .
already not remains much time for that all the parties blended to a agreement .
Some negotiations resulted that investigated in Montenegro but Who can know until that start the party if the team the football consist completely .
The aeroplane special in the that resulted that travel to Podgorica between other the vicepresidentes Dalibor Kucera and Rajchl not has won this morning for problems technical in Prague taking that owns a alternative for carry to part of committee executive the place where noon place the party the classification .
Quizas the meeting decisive for end could be the that noon place to level ministerial that according count is 20 this Wednesday .
To Josef Dobeš minister the Education Youth and Deportes him like much integrate to the parties divided to the organisation integrating more powerful of country for that is comes to a agreement .
There much in game the benefits state the credibility of football and also the next Assembly General of Committee central the federation checoslovaca of sport ČSTV that increase instruments the a new direction the sport Czech after the problems financial the house the loterías Sazka .
Paclík luchará for achieve the presidency because not position a candidate more adequate .
If the head the futbolistas the Pilsen Tomaš Paclik before the Assembly General extraordinary conociera the name the a candidate adequate that satisficiese all their ideas on the new president the Federation Czech the Fútbol FAČR , nor is introduce as candidate to a project so relevant .
&apos; If liked a person suitable excellent fighting for her and not me introduce as candidate to the elections &apos; .
&apos; But until the day the today not is has able find a person case &apos; said Paclík for the Agency the Noticias Czech ČTK .
applies that justifies to Paclík to specific in the challenge with Miroslav Pelta and Henry Rajchl is exactly the possibility the block to Pelta the course winner the elections that opens the road to the presidency the Federation Czech the Futbol FAČR . .
Paclík also puntualiza that in case win permanecería in the office the president only until , when long-overdue the Question the assembly general ordinary .
In that office him like see to a expert and good workforce that not protecting too connected with the events fans .
&apos; already I spoken with some people to the that could having in account &apos; .
&apos; For me was a madness hear to some say that in this moment nor even want identify with the football Czech &apos; .
&apos; I like change that vision &apos; adds .
applies that supposed more bother to Paclík in this moment is the relationship the Pelta with the President the Partnership the Fútbol Regional the Pilsen Pianist Berbr a man with a past controversial known outside of mundillo as a poderoso lobista with capacity the influence in the vote the delegates in the assembly general .
For Paclík is so unacceptable see to Pelta upper in the sillón presidential .
&apos; In case the that gane is Nazarbayev the status unlicensed and nothing in the football change &apos; .
&apos; With the support the Berbra a man the business ambitious the football surrendering still least advantage &apos; said Paclík .
Menciona also the fact the that ago few years the name the Pelta was e-commerce with a Sahara telephone during the research the a case the corruption the opened Pelta went impune .
&apos; not know what prestige the football could attract the victory the Pelta &apos; .
&apos; And with what eyes us plead the UEFA and the FIFA &apos; said Paclík that also decision-making with certain caution his declaration previous that &apos; vendería the Club Pilsen if Pelta is ridiculed in president &apos; .
In the case the win the elections of Thursday Paclík could arise the cooperation with Pelta in the future .
Indeed same opinion is the another candidate Rajchl that has been supported for Paclík before the Assembly General the September that is in a fiasco .
&apos; dear Pelta would the First the that solitary &apos; .
&apos; It very capable &apos; .
&apos; I what could imagine for example as head the representation &apos; .
&apos; but not as workforce the a partnership &apos; .
&apos; I either meto the narices there where not me sorry capable &apos; added Paclík that in September suscitó lot attention for support the suspension the Commission the Árbitros presidida for Ludek Macel potential later for Dagmar Damkova .
Paclík accepts that is atrevería to manage the partnership .
Recurre to their capacities the discharge the companies private therefore since the summer past is also the Director-General of Pilsen that with his support legalising in May the triunfo in first division .
&apos; I strength for change some things in the field the football and contribute to his practice safe &apos; .
&apos; For reduce the influence the some groups the pressure that probably tend to influence in the decisions of committee refunded and the Appellate Libya situations unpleasant said Paclík without hidden their antipatías towards the president of Sparta Daniel Křetínský .
A the priorities also would the consolidate the relationship between the FAČR and the Committee Olímpico Checo with the aid of opened ejercía pressure on the leaders politicians for that Socrates more money the sport the taxes the lottery .
&apos; It each the problems key the that is should anti-smoking the new president &apos; .
&apos; If aumentaran the taxes on the games the gambling as what anuncian the parties politicians support their arguments but blatantly have that Emma where goes to stop everything this money &apos; Other .
Ademas Paclík now not has in account even his partnership with the Club Pilsner although him same claims that the President the FAČR must be &apos; not adviser &apos; .
Pelta is to his increasingly e-commerce with Jablonec and Rajchl with Dukla the Prague .
&apos; not is ideal &apos; .
&apos; But not see sense the fact the yield hypocritically my actions of Club the Pilsen to another person for then again there after a year and half &apos; said Paclík .
Pelta promised to the FAČR new estatutos that acabarían with the point dead the elections .
Two days before the Assembly General the Partnership the Fútbol each the candidates to the presidency Miroslav Pelt promised that in case the be elected Coordinating that the FAČR mayor few new estatutos that sirvieran definitive for deal in the future the controversy in As the regulation electoral .
The representative of Jablonec is positive in As to the meeting the this Thursday in Nymburk and believes that the conflict preelectoral could important towards a solution today with the possible victory of team the football .
already before the elections not investment in September Pelta promised excesses in case the be elected precisely in the representation and in custom funds .
Decidió participate in the Finally minute in the final assembly general for what that this postponed the two months him could go well for defend and submit in a context more broader their ideas on the discharge of football .
&apos; The People the all the levels is ranks of football already ago much time and expected fortunate this Thursday the new President &apos; .
&apos; Sienten that has arrived the hour the that someone gestione the partnership &apos; thinks the man that is couples mainly with the Club the Jablonice but that worked in the Sparta and in the committee executive the Partnership .
For this reason believes having enough experience for manage the football Czech .
Has convinced that behind the problems current with the elections is the euphoria that hung in the era the Ivan Hašek .
&apos; Unfortunately in the Assembly general the June were Projects the estatutos that not were so lifts as all handover &apos; .
&apos; If excluimos find interpretations have a president already since September &apos; warned Pelta .
exact the readaptación of document more important the Partnership Cívica is usó as señuelo for gain to the delegates .
&apos; If me eligen president me what counts as a challenge personal and am ready to respond in case the that this falle &apos; .
&apos; It a issue the principles without the subjects not can as &apos; says Pelta .
Moreover in theory staying not Hanish with their opponents .
already in the past had Sinclaire that is financially mercy with Henry Rajchl the that respects for his training in law remains restrictions the that his oponente would addition his first Vice-President .
already was much time without foremost to Greek Paclík cast the contrary the Pelta not showed pawn with head .
&apos; scarf more the a year in the world the football and already has achieved some successes &apos; .
&apos; Their attacks but were vergonzosos and lot People became amazed for the campaign electoral &apos; .
&apos; For that many the them dudan on his real character &apos; said to his Maracaibo Pelta that continues remains faithful to the statements situation already in September .
Their weapon more powerful is according him his knowledge of football since the widest more lowest until the middle-management .
This final should be escaparate the promotion of football .
&apos; also intentaría deal all the escándalos that Tensions to cause the Bohemians as consequence of scandal the corruption of year past &apos; .
&apos; Immediately later me involucraría in the negotiations with the sector public and the private for ensure that hear enough money for everything the football &apos; said ago two months to the ČTK the candidate the years .
To continuation also promised that his appointment as president of football not comportaría none modification personal the plantilla .
&apos; that fortunate First the tasks the each employed &apos; said Channel to Strahov where after a long-term period the anarquía emigration a nerviosismo comprehensible .
To despite the scenarios doomsday current that is vaticinan foremost the next assembly general him believes that the delegates not Tens in vain this Thursday to Nymburk .
&apos; If the unique point the disagreement be how vote in the third round without doubt what allowing overcome .
&apos; The football needs credibility the opened is recover only if for end has a leader &apos; still two days before the hours more decisive in his career the representative Pelta continues remains positive .
Rajchl promised that under his leadership the FAČR empezaría to work with dwell .
If in the quarter Assembly General its elected the current Vice-President Jindrich Rajchl as new president the Partnership the Fútbol Czech lot People is remuneration surely resentida .
Rajchl promised that in case the be elected is trabajaría blow .
wishes implement a change systematic and do that the Member of committee executive is responsible the each area of football dreaming .
also is compromises to resolve the case the Bohemians improve the relations with the UEFA and the FIFA achieving more money for the football and continue with the work initiated for the previous president Ivan Hašek .
&apos; As president me like commit for completely the football &apos; .
&apos; Since the contacts international with the UEFA and the FIFA until the selection happening for the football professional or the Invariably the young futbolistas the high-level performance &apos; .
&apos; With this not want say that what newspapers everything only &apos; said Rajchl in a interview for the ČTK .
&apos; am a player the team and want destroy the powers of committee executive the stand function that each member conclusion An to a area consolidated &apos; .
&apos; And asignaré tasks difficult for that the football conclusion in each the those segmentos continue forward with much momentum &apos; .
&apos; To lot People this probably not him gustará because busies begin to work very blow and not just criticise the work the others &apos; added .
Due to the atmosphere the criticism in the movement futbolístico is says that has considered the possibility the not stand the new as candidate .
&apos; all know that work hours joys &apos; .
&apos; But need know that this noon sense and that not will People behind the my that me ISD-2 and obstaculizará to each step &apos; mover case the reasons the his indecisión .
&apos; Many People me has said that not please contacted for Source because then is Choice for vencidos also the others &apos; .
&apos; They talking the having faith for not leave case without more &apos; said .
According say him justifies also continue the work that already began with Hašek .
&apos; During those two years is a great part of work that not want that now is vanish &apos; .
&apos; exist processes that is previously started and that appeal his effect inside the a couple the years and not me like that someone the pare &apos; announced Belgian for the fact the that if eligieran the another candidate Miroslav Pelta the situation in the partnership could again to be stand as was before the era the Hašek .
&apos; I believe in the agenda and is something that in my opinion Mirek Pelta not is capable the maintain .
&apos; Underlying the him is on everything across fights People that is ocuparía of football for that outside only a privileged for few ironed elected &apos; .
&apos; They me can reprochar a lot the things but not the fact the that am to favour the someone &apos; .
&apos; defend be objective &apos; .
&apos; want do a football for all because only case is sentirán well all and not only the elected &apos; said Rajchl .
indiscriminate also the idea that only serious Karlsbad the president .
&apos; Although some people seeking Can what contrary have in aspiration do what maximum for Moravia &apos; .
&apos; For example is hour the thinking in the fact the destroy the second division in a part Czech and in another morava whose winners irían to the first division &apos; .
&apos; not is virtual the situation current in the that have only three teams the Moravia what that represents a problem for the players moravos young &apos; said Rajchl .
Although to the pugna the elections presidential is sumó Tomaš Paclík president of Club Pilsner Rajchl not leaves the believing in their possibilities the be elected .
&apos; still sorry having a strong support the Federation Czech the opened me checked as his Vice-President and that knows that behind the me there successes Clarity &apos; said Rajchl whose successes &quot; the savings the should tens the million the NOK the contracts desventajosos the negotiations the contracts televisivos and the negotiations on the law the lottery .
For another hand recognises his part the fault in that the federation not protecting united .
And while civilized that Pelta is &apos; descalificado for recover the confidence in the football Czech &apos; viewed the another contravention Paclík as a candidate strong that yes has something that offer the football .
&apos; Nobody can deny that did a great work for the Pilsen time year &apos; .
&apos; In the case the that make elected probably here what that already began Ivan Hašek and not cambiaria the function significantly the plantilla of personal in the soothe &apos; .
&apos; not want use that to my favour &apos; evalúa case to their rival Rajchl .
The pools more fine the Europe .
Salto the blue .
for Valdés Stanek .
Piscinas since a Therefore incredible gold-encrusted bathing in Budapest Anyone north-west Europe can live his maravilla blue and after a visit to the city or a caminata grown-ups their piernas cansadas in bathing burbujeantes .
A book shows where is position the best welfare in the water .
When Iris Meder completed a journey the research during the year and half past had something that not could.&apos; faltar in his luggage a bañador .
Tumbada the wall on the water miraba the artistic cúpula in what high-level nadaba towards the angelotes the mármol that the expecting in the threshold the baths and is asombraba foremost the baths lying modernista rebuilt meticulosamente .
Le horrible the bathing analysis note in his libreta the moment the all the details interesting on the lifestyle and the history of building .
The historiadora arquitectónica Meder exploró more the pools the this function and the where in his recent book &apos; Badefreuden &apos; the pools covered in Munich the historical palaces of bathing in the Forest Black the &apos; constructions the concrete &apos; in Taunus .
Realizó his &apos; journey for the bathing more exceptional the Centroeuropa &apos; for countries Moreover the Germany Austria and Switzerland visited places the Italy France the Republic Czech Slovakia Slovenia Hungary Romania Poland and a city respectively in Luxembourg Serbia and Croatia .
This German the years is a genuine supporter the culture of bathing .
not wants having nothing that see with the sport says Meder only the water is different .
Only him bother that the sports the bathing Rather that conformarse with azulejos blue and nostrils to chlorine while that the sports to jeopardized can breathe the fascinating smell the forests the abetos or listen the flair trinos the birds in the park .
&apos; A day me liked for what the pools have that be always so feas &apos; claims this head the Vienna .
&apos; Comencé to coleccionar pools fine &apos; .
The surface of water greater the architecture .
The chapoteo in the baths and the etéreos cheeses the sauna The factor the welfare in the pools is so large because is atienden all the ways according Meder .
And if the nonsensical is striving the pools covered can be a real gift for the view &apos; In place the soil in the bathing is has a surface the water &apos; .
&apos; For a part is transparent for another part reflects the beauty the everything the building &apos; .
All is dobla ópticamente the highest bóvedas the azulejos the colours the trampolines .
The book with photographs in format small &apos; Badefreuden &apos; underground in pages data very interesting on the architecture and the history of art in the oasis historical of welfare but mainly five-minute dwell the MRI the blue .
Meder the coleccionista the pools Anglo-Saxon the copies outstanding in their investigations in Hungary .
Together to the magníficos bathing medicinales as the bathing the Széchenyi the Budapest the years is lie the waters with bathing-water in a odd cavidad kárstica bathing in cavidades in Miskolc-Tapolca case as should termas , whose pools are the waters alcalinas and is lie in a building with manner the bottleneck Városi Termálfürdö in Jászberény . .

Indeed three sources open makings vapor in winter while that the fund the mountains the Ötztal is quoting in the sky .

To Meder the coleccionista the pools not him invadía the smell to chlorine in all the pools .
Many bathing termales huelen to sulphur in the bathing the Árpád in Békescsaba Hungary the fever to gasóleo is so strong that the People believes ought arrived to a bathing health .
The smell next the waters medicinales that contain bicarbonato and álcali and whose légamo is pega to the fur the specific in the baths a ironed of welfare the a function special .
Iris Meder also is decepcionó in a place in his search the places bonitos for the bathing when wanted visiting pools descubiertas and bathing the sun in the bathing Czech the Luhatschowitz is reconstruct with a ground blocked .
The bathing the of architect Duan Jurkovic was closed .
When Meder miró to via the desmoronadas windows of building modernista red white and Hindu shaken the Limiting grow between the azulejos .

These bathing have three phases the construction after the yes not only is can compromising elements neorománicos the times the his construction in if not also a hall Arab the lifestyle Alhambra , added in . .
Since his esmerada modernisation in the Palacio Termal is the bathing odds-on the coleccionista the pools Iris Meder , and not only because make natural the Forest Black .

In a palace case the inmersión in the baths spa apparently not has lot importance .

Now is reabre as house the Titanic .
The architecture the postgerra modern apasiona the forms clear the halls the glass the curvas valientes and the new materials the construction classic of thinking on the progress technical for what that the flag austriaco of architect Knight Schwanzer for the exhibition universal the Brussels the is a example adequate and known .
The Pabellón the Schwanzer homeland then the Cardiff Prix the Arquitectura for his lightly and floating construction the steel and glass .

With his legendaria tower the four cilindros for MBW more the building adyacente aplanado in Munich Commissioneru'\u2019s to be comparability known .
Their flag designed as a construction temporary for Titanic is levantó later the exhibition universal in the Schweizer Garten together to the station of southern the Vienna is reformó in and inside is supposedly a museum of century , is phoned the &apos; house &apos; .
The building was adequate but carecía the spaces and technology Will for a museum without none wall for colgar art nor a good environment .
To despite the doing is oath-taking until that the art contemporary in Vienna had a new home .

And the room the cinema is exactly as was before .
And everything this with a control narrower for part the office the monuments and a under budget .
&apos; To often had that find material that outside good cheap and also reminiscences to the office the protection the monuments &apos; claims Krischanitz and means the a soil áspero in the sótano .
To despite the all the pressure problems and reforms the building is keeps flexible and plain .
applies of flag &apos; that wine the Brussels &apos; has been difficult stated ago little Krischanitz a typical &apos; emergence accidental in the history the city &apos; .
A architecture case is &apos; always in the place wrong &apos; and for that wanted &apos; emphasise the awareness suitable &apos; .
In this case the house not is in the place wrong has happened a coup the Fortunately urbanístico The completely new and planeado &apos; chemists the station central &apos; with housing and offices is position together the Schweizer Garten .

The Mullah the eight small employers noticed and Greeks between the years and have a Repression the extreme right-wing .
In Turkey and in the population German the origin Turkish is has reacted with afraid and concern foremost this news .
For many Germans the origin Turkish Croats a fantasma that is creía dead ago time since the attacks with manner the fires in Mölln in November the and in Solingen in May the , not previously happened more episodes the violence with Repression the extreme right-wing against Turks .
not However never is has questioned that in Germany bigger xenophobia .
The network ultraderechista republicans reveals a magnitude whose dimensions not were nor much least previsibles .
&apos; Vuelve to reavivarse the ideology bloody &apos; titula the edition for Internet of newspaper Turkish &apos; Haberturk &apos; .
The newspaper &apos; Sabah &apos; resalta for the contrary that each the authors of crime was a multifariously the Office Federal the Defence the Constitution and is shows Belgian for that the authorities German can be involved in the pantanal ultraderechista .

applies that mean that if the peace internal the Germany is in danger the attacks the Mölln and Solingen is aclararán in nineties years .
The image the ruins of fire the Solingen is has filmed in the bait German and Turkish .
No another basin daring more clearly to the Turks that sub-Saharan here that there a threat concrete and to the Germans that the mistrust and the distance can desembocar in the violence .
The attacks agudizan the sense the group the part Turkish .

The bank of scandal of lago the Zurich .
The bank more arriesgado the Europe not is position in Italy nor France if not in Switzerland .
The UBS almost entered in bancarrota in the crisis financial and since then is deslizó the a crisis to the next .
Now the aimed a German .
certain that Axel Max not what had trans-Atlantic .
After the his spectacular starting the summit of bank federal in July is through that in comenzaría in a new and almost equally the spectacular work President of advice administrative of great bank blessing UBS a inesperado and lucrative step in his career .
Axel Max is pleased publicise commends Switzerland for his beauty and to the UBS for his newly acquired strength and leaves fall comments amables on their Future colleagues .
&apos; The bait has achieved a revival &apos; .
&apos; I pleased cooperate with Kaspar Villiger and Oswald Grübel &apos; .
In September became clear that everything would completely different .
A operators financial the bait in London blackout all the systems the safety of bank and defraudó thousand million the EUR .
Oswald Grübel director general the bait a banker not only known in Switzerland had that negotiating .
The president of advice administrative the bait is viewed since then equally tocado and all filed So When arrives Axel Max .
They through that Max preferably advise the bank since February the . .
And is over office the presidency of advice administrative in May not to principles the , as the bank comunicó the Tuesday .
This is blow for Axel Max .
not is banker more well professor the economy and consejero and has had a period the adaptation surely necessary .
Indeed coup is ago responsible the strategy the a bank that ends the again to prove that deserves the title &apos; the greater bank of scandal the Europe &apos; since ago time .
For a part the bait is enormous until ago little was the greater administrator the property global and for another part since ago years is desliza the a scandal the next .
Nothing case what seems is him ahorra the changed so proud bank blessing .
believing the crisis financial .
The bait had a reputation excellent until . .
The image of administrator the property blessing discreto and hardest but also mañoso is combinó with objectives ambitious also wanted be a great number in the banks the investments .
For a part with 500 the dollars the bait managed more money the customers wealthiest that any another bank of world .
And for another part avanzó as bank the investments in the Politically the large banks of world .
This impresiona .
Hans Geiger the former banker and post-Gaddafi professor the banca in Zurich during many years explains &apos; Faced my students always I described to the bait as model the a good bank &apos; .
&apos; Since the point the view current each is question So How could equivocarme &apos; .
was in a great mistake .
In the year went to the light that something went very bad in the bait .
To middle the year Peter Wuffli director general that until then was considered as a banker genial and very intelligent resigned surprisingly .
Some months later is sospechó the reason .
The fund the investments of bank is embarcó in losses with titles the high-level risk and had that amortizar thousands the million .
For shoulder with this the bait announced a inyección the capital the nothing least that the thousand million the FRF .
For this reconstruct investors course that some miraran with contempt until little before a fund state-based Asian and opaco the Singapore and a fund state-based Arab so discreto that never is had heard his name .
This was only the first coup .
In April the , empeoró .
The bank had that wage the loss the thousands the million Marcel Ospel president of advice administrative in the Secondly best paid advice administrative the Switzerland resigned .
In October the &apos;You the disaster in view the their investments wrong , the UBS is reconstruct in the crisis financial foremost the costing and had that be rescatada for the state .
The bank national compró values problem to the UBS for many thousands the million the Confederation Helvética only six thousands the million the FRF for a bono sensible converted prohibited the that is convertía in copropietaria of bank .
whole Switzerland was affected is stated what dramatic that was this for a country small if aloja to banks so large .
Finally the sum of balance the UBS in was more the five sometimes greater that the results economic the Switzerland see gráfica . .
&apos; not can again to beast to the UBS &apos; said Geiger expert in banca .
To the first disaster is joined the second .
Few months later the UBS capituló in a conflict fiscal with America and is daring ready to limits the data the customers wealthiest that possibly previously defraudado taxes with aid of bank .
Moreover whereby a figure the thousands the million the dollars reimbursed the profits injustificados the these business with a compensation for payment .
With doing the UBS confesó more or least ought helped in the fraud fiscal .
Simultáneamente lost something that had been since always his capital in the competition for customers rich the aureola the discretion .
After the scandal the secret of bank blessing already not is the same .
To this continued the resignation of president the junta directive and of president of advice administrative .
And the exodus the funds the customers .
Indeed this function in few months the bank lost his credibility in their two sectors central in the banca the investments prohibited the speculation flawed and in the administration the property prohibited the aid the fraud fiscal .
And fair when readjust to be something more relaxed fair when is meant that the UBS readjust to do happens this desdichada history of operators a operators individual defraudó thousand million the EUR before the that the bank is diera account the that something cards bad .
And is desveló for what seen this still not works well with the discharge the risk in the banca the investments .
&apos; With the case Adoboli is patent that the controls the risk have changed too little &apos; claims Martin Janssen professor the economy and finance in the Institute Bancario the University the Zurich .
The director financial the a great bank German also is safe &apos; The problem the UBS is that not dominates the controls the risk &apos; .
For what that emerged the idea the caution with the that the bankers Swiss is demands since ago time be the guardian the elderly property of world circumstances risk too large in change the safety of money wants quebrar the another hand the republic sanctity .
The deposits the safety the banks Swiss were the symbol the reliability inquebrantable as Lindt and Sprüngli of chocolate genuine .
The central the UBS in Zurich not Exclusion with the buzz of hardest bank private blessing only is a little greater .
The situation is classical .
The bank has his headquarters main in the street Bahnhofstraße the Zurich that goes since the station main directly the lago the Zurich enmarcado for the summits covered the snow the mountains suizas .
Here the buildings are ostentosos the rented are few the more salaries the Europe .
Here is lie joyerías as Tiffany`s between business traditional Swiss as the confitería Sprüngli .
Here appropriately since ago years the banks Swiss since the bank national happening for the palace the Credit Suisse until the elitarios banks private as Julius Bär .
They enters in the room the reception the UBS prohibited a disproportionately door chair .
Soon the walls are revestidas the mármol front is lie large sillones the leather together the logo of bank there a great letrero for indicate the &apos; safety &apos; .
The UBS knows what that the client search here Security .
The two large banks Swiss the UBS and Credit Suisse in somewhere moment have desplazado the idea of great bank blessing or the have betrayed as his the president the a small bank private blessing .
prefers not read his name in the newspaper the end and the carried ago as all the bankers Swiss also with the business the two large banks .
The UBS is has fact too large his mainly in the banca the investments where the Continental have cattle ground .
There the Swiss not resulted nothing more that say .
&apos; And is have Fitoussi during much time to the grip the Continental &apos; .
Indeed fact the UBS changed the banca the investments Anglo-Saxon handed his first great benefits and then wine the disaster none entity financial European had lost therefore money in the jungla of high-level risk as the great bank blessing .
The October the , the disaster was obvious .
&apos; scheme Wednesday the coalition officials of small country the seven million decided the greater operation the rescue in the history the his nation &apos; says the author Lukas Hässig in his book &apos; Spiegel UBS-Crash &apos; The crash the UBS &apos; in Spanish . .
The politicians Kyrgyzstan until thousands the million the FRF or approximately thousands the million the EUR for save the great bank the bancarrota .
How is them happens .
They talks with the bankers Swiss case Supposing the problem in the dimension the UBS .
In June the , two the three large banks Swiss is fusionan in a poderoso consortium .
Surge a bank that due to the merger was too large for the small Switzerland and continues evolving .
For what that constructive for that the two profits banks precursors the UBS is complementaran a bank wealthy but asleep with the centre the administration the property in Zurich and a internacionalización more poor but more strong .
Indeed suddenly the banks the investment internacionalizados arrived the function swift with much money with the that could do rodar a great bicycle financial .
There two names questions with this efficiently the UBS Peter Wuffli head of consortium the UBS the to and Marcel Ospel , then president of advice administrative .
&apos; always thought that Wuffli and Ospel were a team perfect &apos; says the expert in banca Hans Geiger .
&apos; Wuffli the intellectual modest that pastu'\u2019, much the models and statistics and Ospel the intuitivo that managed Greece step since the learning in the bank until the summit &apos; .
Finally Ospel is fió the Wuffli .
And the final Wuffli cleared probably a mistake decisive &apos; Pensó that their models were a reality &apos; says Geiger .
&apos; It a case tragic &apos; .
Trágico perhaps .
Has clear The desatino arrived before of case .
The employees the UBS is outlined clearly the meetings the superiors in the that Wuffli the head of consortium always repetía the same motto Bajar of Big to Goldman Sachs .
The bank American was the bank the investment more poderoso of world .
Encabezaban the &apos; League Tables &apos; the clasificaciones that then documentaban the success the banks .
The UBS wanted be in the summit .
Some steps him consequently well .
In the operations the divisas and in the negotiation the actions was in what more high-level .
However the advisers the companies makers reacting the highlighted a point weak In the bn of interest international in the language the banca &apos; fixed income &apos; there a compensation enormous for the large banks .
The UBS has vacíos in the products hipotecarios Americans .
For fill these vacíos the UBS started a adventure that almost him costs his existence .
Ávidos the growth invirtieron therefore the same bank as each the their funds the high-level risk New in investments x02BC the high-level risk .
They transformed in a machine powerful for titularizar appropriations hipotecarios Americans and venderlos to continuation manteniendo tense risks to account own .
And also as other banks arrangement the bajada during much time .
&apos; In summer the as the market estate American was in llamas the UBS compró there &apos; said Geiger , expert in banca .
Only large the euphoria so conducting the fall .
A workforce had that technician already that the attempt the governed occasion more complicated the what that expecting .
The jobs in the UBS is separate in seats proyectables and are inseguros until the currently .
Currently cast aimed a great bank has a work almost impossible .
must find a strategy for a bank foremost the that all the models the bn lógicos Purely stumbling .
Geiger expert in banks has a idea put end to the banca the investments focus in the administration the property returning to the roots suizas .
The bank not wants reaching so far still . .
But the banca the investments must decrease much is clear currently .
The next Thursday Sergio Ermotti the new president of bank Accession his future strategy the world .
In reality only is thought in the italiano-suizo the years as a solution Abruzzo already that the bank the bank is separó surprisingly the his predecessor Grübel .

The seconded that represents to hundreds the workers the support school that lost their jobs the month past planea exceeding to the city the Wednesday retracted that the redundancies were plain and deplored due to his impact desproporcionado on the schools that atienden to students poor .
The demand is possibly the final weapon to readiness of seconded of district municipal , in his effort for revocar the redundancies .

The authorities municipal have denied categorically that prosecution .
In a hearing in the Ayuntamiento the month past the consejero the education Ross M. Walcott said that the redundancies were a part of budget approved in June .
A member of Council contraatacó understood that nothing in the budget especificaba that the Member of personal the support the school costsaving dismissed .

Elizabeth Greek spokesman of Department Legal the city said that the city not had seen the demand and for what therefore not could.&apos; do comments on their claims reliant .
According a draft the demand Resources for chosen New York Times the seconded is has focused in the number the redundancies in the schools the areas poor the city for support a complaint for treatment unfair fights that the schools poor lost more assistants already that previously been insuficientemente contrary the manner foretold .
They Other that if well not was redundancies in Staten Island and few redundancies in the schools in the Upper Dundalk Side or TriBeCa 17 assistants schoolchildren lost their jobs in the Cuahutémoc in Brownsville Brooklyn and were dismissed in the Distritos and in the South of Bronx .

P.D. The budget of district is decreased in a for cent this year and also lost money when the city changed the manner in that estimated the funding additional for each incorporate for student poor in the schools .
The seconded also claims that the directors the schools diminish can ought been deceived for the language in a memorándum that authorises the redundant the coordinators the parents .

&apos; Sesenta and six coordinators the parents were dismissed &apos; says the draft the complaint &apos; and not only in surplus &apos; .
Misión draw the Congress prepared for reaching to a agreement on Libya .
seems that finally Republican and democrats in the Capitolio are prepared to undertaken the agreement on something connected with the upheaval in Libya .
All what that is Widespread was that the rebellion mayor success that the contractor dictator Muamar the Gaddafi outside apprehended and murdered and the participation the States United arrived to his end .
The Tuesday the Committee the Affairs Foreign of Senate goes to considered a resolution patrocinada for the president John Kerry democrat for Massachusetts , together with the senadores John McCain republicano for Arizona and Wresinski I. Lieberman independent for Connecticut , aplaudiendo to the Libyans for his successful rebellion and to the troops the US for his &apos; courage &apos; .
&apos; This resolution is for honrar to the valientes the Libya the start to rebuild his country &apos; said Kerry .
&apos; It a assertion the support bipartidista for their aspirations democratic &apos; .
The language can apparently inofensivo but nothing on the debate on Libya has been easy until now .
This summer the legislators the two parties is peleaban between yes and with the White on the drafting the a series the resolutions for approve or reject the role the military the US in the mission the NATO in Libya .
In June Kerry and McCain tabled a resolution that authorises the use limited the forces military the US in Libya .
The project the law was derrotado in the Chamber for a broader margin bipartidista and that never arrived to votarse in the Senate .
But the same day in that the project the law was rejected in the Chamber the chamber also rejected a measure that would recortado the funds for the operations American in Libya .
strengthen showed the mission the US in a species the purgatory legislative with the Congress what enough upsetting as for criticise the WEU for part the Obama the mission but not so enfadado as for in reality segar the hierba under their feet .
To continuation the indecisión of Congress was superada for the events .
Trípoli fell in hands the rebels Libyans in August and Gaddafi was murdered the October .
The mission the NATO is officially the October .
Now the Senate could be Group for act .
The resolution of Committee the Affairs Foreign &apos; welcomes the people the Libya for his tremendo courage and extraordinary resistance for Local to yes ourselves &apos; and &apos; commends to the men and women the Fuerzas Armadas the States United and to their partners the coalition that participated in operations military for protect the people the Libya for his extraordinary courage and professionalism &apos; .
The resolution also &apos; states the interest national the States United in a successful and multi-year transition towards the democracy in Libya &apos; .
Ganará the new measure the completely support the committee the Affairs Foreign or dividirá to the legislators as did the project the law the June .
The final version was rejected for the Senator Richard G. Lugar Indiana , the main republicano of committee .
The spokesman the Lugar said the Monday that not had seen still the version final of new project the law .
At another hand of Capitolio the Chamber goes to vote this week on a amendment constitutional demanding a budget well-balanced a priority legislative for almost all the congresistas Republican and some democrats .
The measure patrocinada for the republicano clocked Goodlatte republicano for Virginia , be the first amendment constitutional on the budget or any another subject that the fact logre a vote the across the assembly in the Chamber or the Senate in this Congress .
Other legislators not have had success until the moment for do reaching their amendments to the assembly but not for lack the attempts .
The Goodlatte is only a the amendments constitutional that is have wonderful in this Congress that abarcan a wider range the subjects .
Some are duplicados the same project the law is proposes therefore in the Chamber as in the Senate and other with Nowadays compensatory between yes .
There for what least versions the amendment of balance budgetary so only in the Chamber and another handful that &apos; Fucino the expenditure federal &apos; .
Some the those projects the law also are idénticos between yes but babies to their patrocinadores on everything Republican job that looking refinar their currículums the opportunity the jactarse the that them were the &apos; authors &apos; the start measure .
The Act the Audit the budget that was Gibraltar in August requirió that therefore the Chamber as the Senate voted a amendment of balance budgetary .
In March 58 senadores voted to favour the a resolution not binding that supports the idea the that amendment .
Over beyond of budget several Member want limit the number the mandatos that the Member of Congress can comply while that the representative José 672 Serrano democrat for New York , wants validity the limit the two mandatos for the chairmen .
The representative Jesse L. Jackson Jr ( democrat for Illinois has proposed a series the amendments that reputable the right to a education the quality and attention health between other subjects .
A amendment that prohibits the marriage homosexual is a proposal perenne case as a that prohibits the burning the flags .
Some legislators also want allowing the written-off the laws federal if are Académie for two two-thirds the states .
Only enthusiasts that have been the Member to the hour the propose amendments not is are pulling to a pace more quickly that in years previous .
In the Congress the legislators participating amendments and tabled in the . .
The pace is unacceptable in comparison with the 1950s the when the Member demands regularly more the amendments each two years , according figures proporcionadas for the Biblioteca of Senate .
But not resulted much more success then the what that what have now .
The final amendment that is added the - was countryman in , but the fact was proposal for the Congress in . .

However Other &apos; In my opinion Libraries be Surely the continue forward &apos; .
applies that is interpone between them and a verdict is this announcement that has been criticada since that is published for first increasingly .
have been a critical permanent the Doctrina Feres .
The army is decades for behind because not has the same incentive and deterrent that begs the responsibility .
And adds &apos; The Adolescent are hotly in against the them but is important for them try &apos; .
These things only editorial when the People good is ready to fight .
If the hearing not goes for his road Burke immigrés the complainant radioactive to the backlog to their other hundreds the complainant for cases Future .
&apos; Are to continue fighting against the army in this subject until that the reform is occurs &apos; says .
&apos; Or until that us muramos what that occurring First .
The walls have eyes How the researchers you are looking in Facebook .
Before the norm in the new pack the extreme right-wing in Europe Anders Behring Breivik was simply another type that aireaba their points the view anti-inmigración in online .
The Monday Breivik cast befriended ought conducted a 22nd in Norway in July that showed dead is Baader-Meinhof to his first hearing judiciary public .
Meanwhile Breivik can ought acted only was far the be only in the ciberespacio bombarded past the greater part of time that concertation to his attack cope to his computer charlando with some the million the nationalists that support to the groups the right-wing in networks social .
After the tragedy the this summer the researchers wanted know more onset the these people .
But So how encontrarlas .
Fácil only future that specific in Facebook .
&apos; We brief account the that not was so difficult reaching to them &apos; says Jamie Bartlett author main the a report published recently on the populism digital European for the centre the studies British DEMOS .
The alijo the information personal the Facebook is so enciclopédico says Bartlett that the researchers could simply use the tool the advertising for determine their characteristics demográficas deseadas with a precise scientific the function that the sellers have state reported during years .
The team the Bartlett reconstruct half million the fan the groups the right-wing in across Europe and then them dirigieron announcements but in place the vincularles to a new broadband or product the dieta the announcements invitaban to the users to optimistic a survey that Surprised on his level educational attitudes towards the violence and the optimism on his own future .
At reaching to via the Facebook Bartlett and their colleagues were Surely the observer to more the followers the parties the extreme right-wing in countries Europeans everything without escape the office .
&apos; It a manner completely new the do a research &apos; says Bartlett .
Some the results not are of everything surprising The supporters in online the groups the right-wing tend to be young men and enfadados for the immigration .
However in a species the issuing &apos; Especially that combined his activismo in online with the activismo outside the online are more reasonable more democratic and least violent that Especially that is left behind the screen of computer &apos; .
The work the DEMOS is only a example the how Facebook is increasingly in a new and important tool in hands the scientists .
Centros the research researchers doctors and scientists politicians are reported the website for observer everything since problems the health to trends social stand as is consent in the &apos; I like &apos; messages in the walls and dialogues the state .
With more the million the users assets agregando a average the three parts the content the day the &apos; supernova the data &apos; the Facebook is formers a booming the research pushing the number the jobs academic with the name of website in the title until almost a % in the recent five years .
For some researchers the beauty the Facebook is that you allows observer to the people to the that not podías acercarte with a carpeta in the street .
&apos; Before when intentabas encuestar to people of Party National British was very difficult identificarlos &apos; .
&apos; Tendrías that go to via of party and them never you nearly the access &apos; says Bartlett .
&apos; Facebook UEN everything that TV to them directly &apos; .
Other say that the website could providing a function the identify and address the problems the salud-social .
A study recent conducted for the doctora Megan Moreno the University the Wisconsin-Madison and their colleagues reconstruct that the students university that Haifa the their hazañas the borrachera in Facebook ones a risk significantly greater the having problems with the drink that the students that refused in silence on the subject .
Moreno suggests that the colleagues the students such as the dispatches residenciales could control the website and intervene for help to a student that studies many dialogues the state with their Binge .
&apos; not portray treat a problem if not what portray diagnosticar &apos; said Apollinaire Christakis the co-autor the Moreno and director of Centre the Health Comportamiento and Development of Niño in the Institute the Research Infantil the Seattle said the Washington Post .
&apos; have met a function the identify children in risk that the another Similarly not costsaving diagnosticados &apos; .
Facebook also is constantly &apos; pinchando &apos; to his own population for obtain data .
The A-Team the Data of website has bill statistics on the state the relationship and the Day the St ribbons the expectation the participation electoral to half of period legislative the , and a index the Felicidad National mainly reported the information to the that is can access defenders the freedom digital ago much time that maintain that the website should put to readiness the other his great amount the data for the research . .
However the users the Facebook know that the website them is we them Whether or not the sacrificio for power play the Scrabble with a friend to thousands the kilometres the distance is allowing that the website mine your information personal .
But what passes when the users the Facebook spend to fortunate part the a survey that nor even local .
Meanwhile that the researchers have guidelines well Advocate on how picking their data outside the online in online is a barra free for all .
&apos; not believe that many the users Europe trans-Atlantic even in the fact the that a researchers could be examining their profiles &apos; says Voyager Selwyn a sociologist of Laboratorio the Conocimiento the London on a study the that subsequently to carried with the walls public the Facebook the students .
&apos; In what that to them precise was only between them and their friends &apos; .
Then is the issue the methodology .
Even outside the online not there guarantee the that a subject the research this remains completely honest .
In Facebook is impossible know that part the information of profile the a user and the messages of wall are truth .
&apos; applies that dices in Facebook and what that pensioner outside the Facebook are two things completely different &apos; says Selwyn .
It for that to despite the their years as researchers the technology Selwyn believes that a sujetapapeles and a bolígrafo continuing remains the best tools the research that nobody conclusion use .
&apos; not there substitute for specific in the world real and talk with the People real &apos; says .
&apos; The research social is supposed that is on what social and a lot the what social still happens outside the online &apos; .
&apos; Frío and inhuman Anders Behring Breivik ago his first emergence public in the court .
Anders Behring Breivik the man that confesó be the brain the two attacks that prime to people in Norway this summer is has dilemma to yes same as a combatiente the &apos; resistance &apos; during his first emergence public in the court the Oslo .
&apos; am a commander military in the movement the resistance Norwegian and in the Gentlemen Templarios the Norway &apos; said foremost a room full with people .
&apos; I opposed the court already that received the mandate the organisations that support the ideology of hatred and because supports the multiculturalismo &apos; .
&apos; recognise the facts but not me declaro guilty &apos; .
The judge Torkjel Nesheim halted to Breivik during that monólogo because &apos; not wanted give to Breivik the opportunity the use this hearing as a platform for that exprese their points the view &apos; .
For the same reason is refused to allowing to Breivik that assassins a speech writing with diagnosed address to the family the their victims the final the hearing .
Nesheim also thirteen to the police maintain to Breivik under custody during weeks more him faiths the access to the media the communication during four weeks and said that the authorities sooner that having a narrower control on all the visits and the correspondencia during eight weeks .
Approximately the survivors and family the victims petition to the hearing .
Some dressed with the expectancy the indifferently to Breivik to the eyes other for confirm that is position recluido under key .
all petition with the objective the important towards the conclusion .
&apos; nonetheless that seemed cold and inhuman &apos; said a superviviente the Utoya to the substantive ​ noruega NRK .
&apos; was embarrassed but for me was a step forward later the see and hear the suspect &apos; .
Vestido with a suit dark and shirt blue Breivik is remained calmado and professional to what long-term the hearing and miró to the journalists and to the survivors to the eyes when entered and went of building .
To despite the strange notion the Breivik the be part the a movement the &apos; resistance &apos; greater the judge determinó that not is a ill mental and said that not there tests the that overtaken with cómplices .
It possible that to some them consuele that the attacks of the July unimaginable be masterpiece the a extremista in place the a group the radical .
But that not suaviza automatically the pain and the confusion that across a nation still feel .
&apos; I like that prompt a monster but not what seems &apos; said a family the a victim .
&apos; would much more easy if what prompt &apos; .

Scalia and Greek cenan with the rival the law the assistance health while the court accepts the case .
The day that the Court Housel is Egyptian to door doors for examining the issue politically controversial the if aceptarían the challenge to the law the assistance health of president Obama two the their magistrates Antonin Scalia and Clarence Greek were agasajados in a dinner patrocinada for the signing the lawyers that expondrá the case foremost the high-level court .
The occasion was the past Thursday when the nine judges is gathered in a hearing preliminary for observer blueprint the petitions the review .
One the cases in issue was a demand tabled for states desafiando the reform total the assistance health Gibraltar for the Congress the year past a law that has been a cry the war for the activists Conservatives in everything the country .
The magistrates acordaron admit to rubber-stamping the demand and the fact is expected a plea historic the hours and average for March and the result probably enturbiará still more the career presidential the , that consist in plenary changing in the moment in that the decision of court is No .
The lawyer that comparecerá foremost the court and alegará that the law must be desechada be probably Paul Clement cast constructive as fiscal general the US during the government the Orwell W. Bush .
The signing the lawyers the Clement Bancroft PLLC was a the almost two dozens the companies that ayudaron to patrocinar the dinner annual the society Federalista a group that brings many years dedicated to the defence the principles legal Conservatives .
Another signing that patrocinó the dinner Jones Day represents to a the associations commercial that desafió the law the Federation National the Negocios Experts .
Another patrocinador was the .Latin farmacéutico Pfizer Inc , that has a enormous interest financial in the result of dispute .
The dinner is legalising in a hotel the Washington hours later the hearing preliminary of court on the case .
Among the assistants was between other Mitch McConnell the republicano more important in the Senate and a Maracaibo declared the law the assistance health .
The guests special in the dinner Scalia and Greek .
not is nothing new The two judges have state factual to events the society Federalista during years .
And not is something that between in conflict with the rules ethical .
Indeed fact the judges are exentos of Licence the Conducta that applied the actions the magistrates federal ashamed .
If not what finally could what that caerían under the Licence Canon 4C that says &apos; A judge can attend to events for custom funds the organisations Spectrum-related with the law and other although the judge not can be a speaker a Vladimir the honour or record in the programme the stand event &apos; .
However the proximidad absolute the Scalia and Greek to two the bufetes the lawyers in the case as to a company with a enormous interest financial was enough for alarmar to the activists the ethical in the government .
&apos; This impressive healed the ethical and fighters towards the code goes in against the demands the several magistrates that playing the court for the same rules that is apply to all the judges federal &apos; said clocked Morin the president the Common Cause Causa Position . .
&apos; The judges were agasajados in a tax-obsessive the funds the wined with lawyers that have cases outstanding foremost the court &apos; .
Their emergence and assistance in the tax-obsessive the funds for this event undermines any demand the impartiality and is unacceptable .
Scalia and Greek have shown little interest for the criticisms that say that mezclan too easily the activity of court with the agenda impulsada for groups as the society Federalista .
And the wife the Greek Ginni is a excel encountered conservative .
For another part the Conservatives argue that is the magistrada Shcharansky Kagan the that has a problem Ethical not Scalia and Greek .
Kagan worked as procuradora general the administration Obama when is tabled the first challenges legal to the law in the court the first ultimately .
Their critical have preferred for that Kagan is Moumia the see the case fights that was too involucrada in defend the law as for now be &apos;It .
Kagan not has prioritised none indication the that what demands to do .

The Pentagon already is digiriendo the thousand million the dollars the tries to what long-term the next 1950s but now afraid a reduction additional the thousand million or more in cuts that can be spelling if the Congress not manages reaching to a agreement on the expenditure .
&apos; The impact the these cuts would devastating for the department &apos; said Panetta in a letter to the senadores John McCain republicano for Arizona and Lindsey Graham republicano for Carolina of South .
She that the failure of Congress for reaching to a agreement on the budget and his consequence the so-called &apos; hostages &apos; Choice place to a for cent the tries global and a high-level to many projects new .
&apos; A correspondingly so large applied the this function indiscriminada newspapers that the greater part the our projects sonars and the construction not is Public enforce not is can buy three cuartas parties the a ship or a building and reputation seriously other efforts the modernisation &apos; wrote Panetta to the senadores .
&apos; also us veríamos forced to apartar to many the our officials civilians the manner involuntaria and due to that the reduction is impondría with never quickly is almost safe that probably that licenciar civilians with the end the comply the objective &apos; .
&apos; These changes romperían the faith with Especially that Other our army and dañarían seriously the good readiness &apos; .
The cuts with the time alcanzarían to the troops the combat said Panetta .
&apos; If well the funding for times the war in the accounts the Operaciones the contingencia in overseas not is sees directly affected for the hostages the efforts the war is rectors affected adversely for the serious disruptive in the budgets the basis &apos; warned Panetta .
&apos; The procurement the personal is reduciría what that instead to delays in the contracts and the supervision of contract that supports the war &apos; .

&apos; It a tiger the role a army the cuarteles buildings and bombs without enough soldiers image for comply the mission &apos; said Panetta in their words the opening in the Pentagon .

How deception us encountered .
In a day anybody the studies keen that you can lying in any place the to sometimes .
That safe many the matters Though are Though piadosas .
Another study daring that the strangers mentían three sometimes in the first minutes the conocerse .
Detectar Though or &apos; the traceability the Though &apos; is a Nicklaus essential that must acquire all for reasons therefore personal as professionals .
multiply the be a game the table similar to for example Charada where the objective is exclamar &apos; You have &apos; the detection of deception is a resources of knowledge serious lines in data scientists gulf during the latest six decades in prestigiosas universities that post-election projects the research in depth particularly in psicología and fisiología .
One the results the research is that the Old mitos onset the lie have been rebatidos .
The mentirosos yes watching to the eyes .
not always tartamudean balbucean is ruborizan or inquietan .
not is can conclude either that the mentirosos is difficult the detect or unmasked .
A detector the Though trained can reaching to the truth lesson onset the structure the declaration the expresiones microfaciales the training the questions and the times .
court several years sondeando the descubrimientos scientists on the deception in the spectre and always shining body of knowledge and was clear that the detection of deception is a technical modern that is easy the learn and aid to foe for our complex world particularly if their responsibilities professionals include the procurement interviews or the discharge the negotiations .
The good mentirosos have the Nicklaus the read well to the others legitimate Differences to tailor-make manejando their emotion and sintiendo the manner intuitiva how the league the others .

First variation the Code become of taxed .
This is way &apos; create a online the basis &apos; .
Aid to providing points the reference for compartment later the changes .
Observe the position of taxed risa and feature blues .
It best that telling if someone normally golpetea with the ordinary everything the time for not do accusations upon when him anywhere the feet golpeteando in half the meeting .
To continuation busque groups the behaviour dull verbales and not verbales .
Considere to these groups the behaviour as signals the alarm not as test the deception .
The people that dupe can freeze the part higher of body the treat the remember his history can emphasized their feet towards the door inclinarse towards a exit change his position the function significantly or exhibir a &apos; desahogo postentrevista &apos; that overstating suspiro the alivio and change the position a increasingly that all the questions difficult have ended .
To often the interrogadores for see falsamente that the interview has ended only for seek that alivio postentrevista .
also giving attention the vocabulary of taxed .
Scott Peterson metió the pata until the fund and usó the time past while tenders that his wife murdered was viva lanzando a search the her to level national .
The people that dupe also can use a language distanciador &apos; not had relations sex with that woman the señorita Lewinsky &apos; or repeat a question difficult accomplished .
The indicators verbales more common are sutiles .
&apos;So can use a lot the &apos; language restrictive &apos; when &apos;Not to a question difficult &apos; Well to say truth until what that I is to my understand &apos; .
This ago that the answer make a percepción in place the a fact and is to often a signal the vigilant .
not there none formula mágica for detect Though but develop skills for compromising the deception is possible .
These skills improve the possibilities the anybody for avoid be victimizados for the artists the mischief in their lives professionals and personal .

So that us emociona wear our music Hence .
They what wonder because exists a species the devoción towards the broadband the fan sub-Saharan with modern the days prerequisites .
What them say to their more fervientes followers .
Thank for tall to our hand to via the all these years .
We three-and-a-half almost years reaching to Côte Rica thanks for ought coming therefore and lamentamos that us hear smile therefore time in reaching until Hence .
frozen People even already is refers to his viewers as the shows more large of year .
Le adds that a little the pressure to his visit .
Some the shows more large that have tocado during the recent years sucedieron during the Finally couple the weeks .
Tocamos a couple the shows gigantescos in Sao Paulo and to that us hear project in manner for this viewers in Côte Rica .
Indeed truth are very desperately the touch Hence .
Amamos that country us love surfear and the jungla for sides things Côte Rica is between the best of world .
How was that abused Côte Rica and their Ecumenical for surfear .
We many friends that are surfeadores and have a great friend that lives in Tamarindo and the Ecumenical Hence are influenced .
My friends always is assurances to surfear to Côte Rica and Nicaragua together with Mexico are large places for surfear case was how us enteramos for half the People that loves the surf .
At see the novel have womenu'\u2019s entregando shows enormous with many songs .
What have planeado for his presentation in Côte Rica .
As never have tocado Hence before then not have none Restriction on what that can do .
Intentaremos give the best shows possible with a good variety the songs trataremos the touch a couple the songs the each album and them to our fan a good and diverse repertorio .
You never echo the repertorio .
To what is must this .
believe that is partially because have nine disks and can touch more the songs and to each him Black-and-white different songs case that is difficult decisions revels songs touch each night .
When have two or three songs in the repertorio that We pink the not touch that us keeps enfocados and also us keeps surprised because us reminds the reasons for the that us gustaban matters songs and that is us could ought neglected .
That ago that the shows make more interesting for us and for therefore believe that also what again more interesting for the People .
With this novel are &apos;clock years the personal .
At indifferently dating So is difficult the believing everything what that have achieved .
Yes absolutely .
In first place believe that none the us is 900 that better in a great broadband the diplomat and They fact for more the years ago that connected as a dream .
Do illustration our bendiciones and us emociona much that can continue doing music together .
all us want and us love create music .
are lucky the go to places of world to the that always quisimos go .
The things not could be best for us .
What meant for you the ought been part fundamental of Allies of grunge .
always has been a honour be part the that group the large gangs .
are very friends the People the Soundgarden Mudhoney and Alice on-site Chains .
It surprising when a movement arises the a group the friends and is something little common .
Indeed increasingly in when arises a broadband the a city but is much more strange when five or ten gangs happily the same time the a same city .
We proud and honest the be part of group the Seattle .
still tocamos with some the them the increasingly in when .
The year past fought in a festival with Alice on-site Chains and fought in Canada with Mudhoney saw to Soundgarden in his novel case that are lucky the be friends the all them still and us honour be part the that technician the Seattle that emerged .
also is very strange that a broadband as the you is keen united and with the ourselves Member for therefore time .
Yes four the us have are together for years and Matt Cameron is us joined ago years what opened for yes only is much more time of that gall many gangs .
In first place believe that all are lucky the be still with life and in Secondly all us preaching for the others .
all are friends very closest and thanks to that also is have open avenidas music that him babies freedom to each the buying .
We enjoys the few to the other with the music the each and not could be best .
The relationship the you with the word reputation not has been simpler without however thanks to his success have able do what that organize .
How lie a balance .
To as have gone evolving has been more easy find a balance .
We attending the that not be too the novel because is easy fall in that game the large multitudes and the People that loves your music .
Meanwhile each democrat that the People is Hence for the music that you democrat that misjudgement respect the music and what that the assassins without encapricharse for be famous and be a diplomat star something that to none the us really him interested .
How reminds his another project Mother Love Bone .
believe that escribimos very good songs and the principle was something Preparations .
Treaty a broadband for almost three years and never tracing a disco until that later the that muriera Andy Symeou Woods . .
was many frustraciones because durara therefore and what more important is that still are very friends the Bruce Fairweather and Greg Gilmore that detected in the broadband with us and when hear a song or see a photograph thinking in the incredible person that Andy was and how me was cry always was a pleasure go to work reírnos , talk the music and futbol and much more .
was a be human surprising and what extrañamos .
The broadband national The Robertas be the charge the opening the shows in Côte Rica .
It true that you local his work in special Eddie Vedder and that for that the escogieron for the opening .
Yes the production us sent videos with several proposals and that was the broadband that more us about case that are desperately the see what that The Robertas can offer in alive and duty be very &apos; .
For what always editorial the letter the Yellow Ledbetter in alive .
constantly is a question for Ed Eddie Vedder , case that not know .
dear the singing and believe that what ago with what First that is him occurring .
As bajista revels are their impartiality .
are so .
Soon the first that is me occur are Geezer Butler John Entwistle contracted A4-0552 Ramone John Doe Paul McCartney Chuck Dukowski .
are many that could talk across the afternoon on the bajistas that me crazy .
How has achieved Pearl Jam maintain relevant the grunge to despite the not be already a fashionable .
believe that all us always us devices a little desconectados the word grunge .
When thinking in her me reminds the gangs that list before as Mudhoney Soundgarden Nirvana and all the that Tensions the same time and if there colossal now believe that is something marvellous because is music that purpose the worth listen and gangs as Mudhoney are doing now best music that never .
At principle his music had a content more dark and now is has journey more positive .
To what is must this change .
It interesting because believe that there a couple the songs in the new album that stand increasingly unimaginable more livianas but also there songs as chosen End or Just Breathe that meddles as songs very shameful although can sound a little Positive .
With sides when Ed me the tocó lloré when the racked and are songs deeply shameful .
believe that when creces and there somewhere trauma in your life and is lose to a family or a friend matters things begin to influence your art and your music and matters two songs without doubt represent that for me .
also believe that is can be a person happy and still case power do music that make brown-skinned .

Chernobyls people abandoned the midday the yesterday anonymity the inmueble that high-ranking illegally and where organizaban macrofiestas that desesperaban the vecindario for agenda judiciary and without need the a intervention police .

At hand of building there a discoteca Balmes , that also is has seen multi-media .
Their owner Maria Pantinat mover to Europe Associated that since that the building was occupied the bn has goods a % .
The owner the discoteca urgency that the invaders the finca him Americans competition unfair already that vendían the copas to three EUR while in the discoteca valen . .
Moreover the owner of local the leisure had that respond to complaints vecinales for noise while according pointed the bother not the rights the customers the discoteca but the inhabitants the house okupada and on everything the assistants to the situ that is organizaban there that previously risen his often and modern in the latest weeks according the enojados neighbours the zone .

Parque or mountain .
The architects implementing in the opportunity the notice more beyond the controversial on refunded .
The Contest municipal on the doors reabre the debate on the role the Collserola in Barcelona .
Amediados the , in plenary changing the already extinta Corporación Metropolitana the Barcelona CMB , this Administration imprimió few pasquines the promotion the Collserola .
The folleto definía the mountain as the great park the Barcelona heavy .
It more is acompañaba the a comparison in figures with the Central Park neoyorquino .
With the death the CMB in the park returned to situarse in the imaginary the many as the limit higher the Barcelona , remains the capital catalana the few that not is orientan in the penetrate north-south but upwards mountain -abajo sea . .
The rating the Collserola as park natural widest in this idea .
The reference already not was Central Park but Yellowstone with the jabalís in the role of oso Yogi .
In these is was until that in September the City convocó a megacompetición states for notice for other so doors the access to Collserola .
A door liberalisation to the idea the park without doubt .
Or that or someone intended put doors the camp .
The question its speak Collserola So park or mountain .
The Contest therefore for his funerals assures organizativa as for what that supposed the reflection on the city is the subject the conversation between all the architects barceloneses .
It almost already a subject recurrent the that spoil momentum when two Member the this former untouchables the elected is recognise in a lift .
And this fact five-minute ordinary precisely to a the few coincidencias between what that Afghan three architects barceloneses and teachers university that is have tabled .
Miguel Roldán Daniel Mòdol and Marta Bayona the Contest is fit .
For Roldán after addressed the cope shallow &apos; is ago necessary &apos; discuss on &apos; the cope the mountain &apos; across increasingly that the speech the Ildefons Cerdà the cultivation devote not is has led to carried .
&apos; Is onwards the basis the that the park more eels the Barcelona is the tan .
Among other things for his great accesibilidad .
Collserola is more complex &apos; judgment the architect for cast the title the &apos; doors the Collserola &apos; within a &apos; trap léxica &apos; not there that thinking in them &apos; as the accesos to a park but the delimitación the should areas where there that act &apos; .
Mòdol as Roldán and Bayona with experience in the world urbanístico status the proposal the &apos; challenge intellectual &apos; with &apos; some dangers &apos; .
Peligros derivatives the what &apos; uncertain that is today day project the space public &apos; after the experience vivida in the and that had in the zone of Fòrum &apos; his low-key of cisne &apos; .
The first fear is the own delimitación the should borders on where is can build .
&apos; Limiting something is implement already the next step &apos; is say his sobrepaso .
&apos; There that thinking in new instruments urbanísticos the planning because the current in reference the Plan General Metropolitano PGM &#93; can give ordinary to auténticos disasters &apos; .
Over ceñido to the question Mòdol his that simplificando the funerals vallesana the Collserola &apos; can understood as a park the Barcelona not &apos; for a issue assures topográfica .
Mòdol reminds that already exists a work fact for the Patronat the Collserola that &apos; not must fall in lump socially &apos; although thanks the opportunity that the City provides to his gremio the intervene in this project &apos; since the first moment &apos; .
And still more pastu'\u2019, that the cercanía the mountain with the city is the convince that allows to the architects specific in the debate but &apos; doubt &apos; on if is this profile technical the that must chair the teams multidisciplinarios &apos; everything a identifies &apos; urgency that is have had that create &apos; The architects should be only a tool &apos; .
Bayona catalogue that the answer to the question that five-minute title to this piece is complex because in the foundations of Contest lack a vision global the Collserola &apos; They have blessing notice Also -dice- in the sense montaña-mar but not exists a reading longitudinal that anywhere and understands the area in his whole &apos; .
of causing the least in his case that hear chosen for participate in the notice .
Indeed another Similarly a project for a the doors can chocar in programme and definition with the of architect the door the hand .
In his opinion that yes the City should ensure that the Strip immediately higher to the Round the Dalt should envisage in across his Without a zone the equipamientos that efectuara a &apos;Softly transition between the city and what green .

Vuelo identity .
accordance to the normatividad aeronautics the flight is completed under the rules the flight identity this involves that the tripulación must having visibility during the flight and the ground .
Condiciones weather .
The reportes in the AICM ubicaban conditions practices the sleep conform developing the aeronave towards the area bordering between the DF and the State the Mexico is demands Rain the nubosidad to low height .
Rutas seleccionadas .
It likely that for the conditions the nubosidad the tripulación hear buscada a zone the unemployed raising and greater visibility towards the valley the Cuernavaca .
Ubicación of impact .
The coordenadas the impact and the Finally registration the aeronave of radar implementing probably before of impact not was loss the control nor breakdown in the personal the flight .
Dispersión the leftovers the aeronave in a zone reduced .
The information available until the moment Youth resorted that the impact happened in a personal straight and the hand .
The patrón the dispersión the leftovers the aeronave Youth resorted that the Hawk is impactó in the ground in conditions the integrity structural .
not is has Previous obvious the firearms or explosion .
In the website of Behaviour continuing without revelarse evidencias in the leftovers the nave the somewhere type the explosion or firearms .
The recent results the research indicate that could ought had multiple contacts with the ground .
During the jobs the camp is have met parts the aeronave to a raising the thousand feet on the level half of sea the ground where a outstanding that goes since the seven degrees until degrees the gradient .
The photographs keen the sequence in the that expected is desarticuló to what long-term the said pack .
The information underground elements that seem indicate that the Hawk could ought had multiple impactos in the ground .
After the search cleared in a zone more wider that the website acordonado around of accident not is have met parts pieces the aeronave what that strengthens the presumption the that the impact is presented in conditions the integrity structural .
MSS inter-institutional protocol for finding gene the obesity .
Dirige the certain Social a research for compromising the gene the obesity in children and young is supported in specialists of IPN .
The Institute participate of certain Social IMSS announced that aimed a research for compromising the gene the obesity in children and young so-called protocol la Genética the obesity the childhood and the adolescence la that permit count with marcadores associated the obesity .
In a communiqué the head the Unit the Research Médica in Bioquímica of smoke-related the Especialidades of Centre Médico National Siglo 21st Miguel Cross Valverde mover that is in-house a team multidisciplinario the doctors nurses nutriólogos and definite social .
words team is supported for specialists and pupils the postgrado of Institute National the Health Public INSP and of Centre the Research and the lawmaking Avanzados Cinvestav of Institute Politécnico National IPN . .
In the research is taught to participate to the population make or not derechohabiente negotiating to the units sporting participants of IMSS in the Valle the Mexico where is . to carried the tests to the minors all the lottery to onwards the : hours .
Destacó that the protocol started in the Unit Deportiva Cuauhtémoc State the Mexico Poniente and that since the October the activity is brings to carried in the Unit Deportiva Nezahualcóyolt State the Mexico Middle . .
A increasingly that is Valencian the objective the towards to or minors the study Unions in the Unit Deportiva Independence southern of Cuahutémoc Federal and finally in the Unit Deportiva Morelos the north of Cuahutémoc Federal . .
Explicó that the purpose the this research is fortunate the components and the importance the Genetic with regard the development the obesity and identify in children and young Mexican factors the risk for preventing the emergence the diseases chronic degenerativas .
At apart this the November the Day World the Diabetes precisó that the objective is towards to three thousand children and young between six and years the age with the consent and supervision the their parents for the application the cuestionarios specific on food .
also is them preguntará on the activity physical and record heredofamiliares the diseases with the purpose the avoid factors the risk that desencadenen padecimientos as diabetes or end-stage renal .
Detalló that the lottery is them applies to all the participants measurements antropométricas weight stature circumference the cintura decision-making the pressure gauges determination the levels the glucosa triglicéridos , colesterol and insulin and genetic is search identify genes that is asocien to the obesity infant . .
Cross Valverde pointed that this research temper to the concern the professionals the health for the alarming increase the weight in the minors .
la The polls the health the and signal that in so only six years was a fastest-growing in the case the children the for cent in obesity and the girls the for cent in terms the obesity also is observed a ascent dramatic la upgrading the specialist of IMSS .
Indicó that the justification for the search the marcadores is sustenta in that the population of country differ the other for his history Genetic .
informed that in average the Mexican has for cent the inheritance Indian American 30 for cent European and five for cent wage and this condition is reflects in the genes that is peer to diabetes and lengthy the weight .
Explicó that the function general the Genetic the obesity is translates in the inability the Limiting the lengthy the energy that consumimos lowcalorie and that is stored in manner the blubber .
The researchers mover that the benefit direct for the participants is the assessment all-embracing the children what that allows detect if similar somewhere rise the obesity or obesity .
Even said the presence the pliegues the colour obscuro acantosis in bottleneck and antebrazo that indicate the probably the that padezca alteraciones metabólicas and until prediabetes .
The information is bikers the manner confidential the doctors the entregan for writing to the parents to who is them explains each a the measurements and the changes in the lifestyle the life that must perform for preventing diseases .
Cross Valverde mover that there three components main that cause obesity and other padecimientos crónicos the sedentarismo that is the lack the activity physical daily tall the greater part of day upper cope the television and use media the transport in place the walking distances short-haul .
also is must to the high-speed ingesta calórica is say the greater consumption the alcohol azucaradas the carbohidratos tamales bread pizza hamburger etc with high content in unprocessed and injected and the Genetic that is analysing in this protocol .
Asfalto the UNAM evitaría bumpy .
Raphael Herrera researchers the Tatiana the Química the UNAM develops asfaltos modified with polímeros for produce a mixture with best risk regardless the conditions environmental and the temperature .
If the signals that sending the pavimento surely civilisation not would necessary reparar closely the thousand bumpy each season the dry in the Zona Metropolitana of Valle the Mexico warned Raphael Herrera Nájera researchers the Tatiana the Química FQ the UNAM cast assured that if the process the construction and peacekeeping the a pavimento asfáltico is the adequate the bumpy could radioactivity in amount or even disposed for completely .
In his conference A opinion technological the bumpy dictada in the framework of Year International the Química only to fortunate that the laboratory to his office develops asfaltos modified with polímeros for produce a mixture with characteristics insignificant to the of asphalt but with a greater resistance mechanics therefore to highest as to lowest temperatures .
Herrera Nájera estimó that this type the asfaltos modified could used in places where the climate is extremely hot as some cities of north of country for improve his risk and for what therefore the training the bumpy .
Explicó that the asphalt the part more disproportionately of oil is a whole the moléculas the hidrocarburos should the high-level weight molecular law asfaltenos and other the under weight molecular law maltenos that EMIs him babies the pavimento his readiness behaviour viscoelástico .
The behaviour viscoelástico of asphalt prevent in that to highest temperatures closely the degrees is practically as a Liquid-fuel to degrees Celsius his viscosidad is very high-speed and to degrees Celsius where a state almost hardest while that to temperatures very lowest the asphalt is again quebradizo added .
applies previous mean that in the streets the resistance of asphalt not is uniform but that is goes added during the day the agreement with the conditions environmental and the temperature warned the specialist in engineering chemistry .
The researchers the FQ observed that the streets the City the Mexico in his majority are covered for pavimento flexible the opened is consists the six Rain the materials the subjects the latest three involucran the asphalt .
Among the Rain more superficiales is position the carpeta asfáltica conformada for small stones bañadas in asphalt and then compactadas .
Every a the piedritas that represents the carpeta pointed is bañada with asphalt .
At transitar the vehicles and generarse efforts unknown allows that the forces is distributing very well in the pavimento .
If is private the asphalt amended is difundirían still best issuer the engineering chemical .
Above the carpeta asfáltica abundó is spur a final layer so-called carpeta the rodadura the opened is benefit the a material the stone fine is say a bit that also is baña in asphalt .
As is talking the layer that goes to be in contact with the llantas the vehicles must having more strength mechanics that the carpeta asfáltica and providing fricción in the road .
At be the part of pavimento that goes to receiving and salvage the efforts the carpeta the rodadura required also having the thick adequate and is must responsibilities the material of that is benefit .
The climate particularly the moisture and the compensatory the temperature also are a factor very important to considered in special the water said because affects considerably the risk the carpeta asfáltica .
When the ground is humedece the water is disseminate in the internal the carpeta and is difficult that charters this macro-economic a reblandecimiento the all the Rain of pavimento and for what therefore the training the bumpy .
In the process the training the a bache said the first in desgastarse is the film the rodamiento and only later is affects the carpeta asfáltica but the harm not happens instantáneamente but that is a process that should atenderse to the initial signals with Will programmes the peacekeeping .
The also member of Senior National the Investigadores mover that the burden vehicular is another factor important in the training the bumpy and for doing the thick the each a the Rain of pavimento must go always in relationship with the burden vehicular and ensure that is Valencian for avoid that is train bumpy frecuentemente .
Raphael Herrera warned that still there much that grips and work on the asphalt for example the emulsiones asfálticas that in other countries already is lie even in the market and Youth reparar the bumpy with easily and without need the use highest temperatures .
What him wilfully to the Cresson of Valle for be the new señorita Colombia .
Análisis the factors that incidieron for that Melina Ramírez Serna not alcanzara the nickel the Señorita Colombia .
The Valle receives his title number the recounted .
Indeed new the Valle of Cauca is remains with the dwell the nickel the Señorita Colombia .
This increasingly Melina Ramírez Serna is had that shaping with be in the podio the ganadoras lucir the nickel the silver and the broadband that the acreditan as new recounted the Colombia .
With the result Resources anoche in Cartagena where the señorita Atlantic is alzó with the nickel and the cetro the department already sum titles the Princess and Melina is a to the legión the women vallecaucanas that have state closely the nickel but that were proclamas princesas between them Valdés Ospina Benoit 1947 , Clara Domínguez Borrero 1949 , Patricia Bellini Ayala 1979 , Longwy Álvarez 1981 , Rose Mary Alzate 1983 , Olga María Arenas 1987 , Leila Blanque 1988 , Mónica Evers 1989 , María Consuela Pinedo 1990 , Diana Isabel Romero 1993 , Giselle Garcés Aljure Frassoni , Catalina Giraldo preparing , Stephanie Garcés Aljure Opportunities . .
Today the great question that many is for is What wilfully .
Because the result represents the defeat the a great favorita that in each presentation proved that her had everything for be the new Señorita Colombia not in vain was elected Reina the Police and better Rostro Jolie the Vogue titles that able reinas as Taliana Vargas or Natalia Navarro cast is procedures the nickel the Señorita Colombia .
The first factor that is viewed key in the decision that three-and-a-half the jury the designarla First Princess assurance in that not convenció with his answer to the question &apos; What is that book that you has packaging to you and for what benefit for Martín Murillo Gómez the Carreta Literaria Leamos .
At interrrogante the vallecaucana replied .
&apos; read much believe quite in the literature believe that is a manner the culturalizarse definitive believe that the book that me espoused the childhood is &apos; The principito &apos; is a book quite discontentment .
Currently leo &apos; Crimen and punishment &apos; is a book the literature universal that all must read and today in day am read the book the Irene Nemirovski a Russian a book hermosísimo that is way &apos; The ardor the blood &apos; .
A answer that little about First for the term &apos; culturalizarse &apos; and Secondly for not explain the function concrete the what function each the books that citó the have packaging .
But the conclude the ceremony Melina manifested justly relaxed and happy with the result &apos; the universe is sabio passes what that has that pass .
And for across the People for favour read a poquito &apos; The principito &apos; is a great book &apos; .
Among the hipótesis Voyager is says that to Valle the quemó the favoritismo .
A journalist bogotano insinuó that the be the Bilbao the ovacionada and the Cresson that is was all the prizes hypothetical challenge the gastronomía Oster vote of public for the best suit non-industrial and Reina inner-city &apos; that adherents the celos the other candidate , estresó to the dominated and for that not brilló in the scene &apos; .
And that is notó in his first presentation in suit the bathing in the tan of Hilton and their two desfiles in the memorable the coronación .
Although in two lució safe is notó that him missing the strength and the impetus that the representatives the Magdalena and Atlantic yes Valley .
Ariel Osorio journalist of programme &apos; As in house &apos; of Channel RCN issuer that the fact the that Melina outside abroad recounted &apos; checked that the Cresson that more prizes earns during the Contest not remains as dominated &apos; .
Moreover Valle is daring to what Finally very esquiva with the press and Hence is equivocó .
Another hipótesis is that Valle not annexed convince the jury on his interest towards the work social that is in latest the essence of Concurso National the Belleza .
For something two days before the election the jury international Lucy Doughty manifested that them buscaban a woman comprometida with the modifying social the his pais .
&apos; The beauty speak not enough in a Miss Colombia there that indifferently stronger beyond the what physical and excesses in his sensitivity social that before the imply the Concurso Purely already involucradas in projects &apos; mover .
also is especula that Valle pecó for their flaws in the derriere and the fibrosis that is him notaba in his abdomen but is planetary therefore precisely the jury the checked as the Cresson la Belleza natural la with the body more healthy good food and work physical responsible .
The preparador the reinas Borg Hernán Orozco recognises that Melina not had the best body that had best &apos; but his problem the fibrosis in the abdomen that the truth for my not was very notoria him nor points in the Finally day &apos; .
Among therefore the journalist Guido Hoyos the magazine Cromos viewed that the mistake the vallecaucana were the speeches quirúrgicas that is practicó .
&apos; The cirugías are well but Valle not is the learned do .
Their body never was his strong and here is the cobraron &apos; .
For this award that for first increasingly handing the Concurso National the Belleza later of parade in suit the bathing emerged a debilitating vaticinio that anoche is factors therefore is truthfully that this was the contentillo that Raymundo him concedía to Melina for not respect the tailor-make the nickel .
Realidad or not what true is that Melina since today starts a year the reinado not as sovereign but as recounted position that him offered the possibility the 84 to Colombia in each the certámenes international for designation of own Concurso National .
However her examined to the history as a the reinas that to despite the his arrollador step for Cartagena him was esquiva the nickel .
So was the work of caleño that lighthouse the cadáver the Alfonso Cano .
A lofoscopista the Cali Commissioneru'\u2019s to the history as the man that confirmed the death the &apos; Alfonso Cano &apos; .
The work the these officials is key .
The past the November a lofoscopista of CTI the Cali Commissioneru'\u2019s to the history as the man that confirmed the identity of maximum head the Farc &apos; Alfonso Cano &apos; to via of cotejo the their fingerprints digital .
Indeed the seven lofoscopistas that laboran in the seccional of CTI that week him tocaba the Question the &apos; availability &apos; to Eliazar González a man the Rico Tejada that brings years working in the area the research judiciary .
At begin his career González worked in municipalities of Chocó where many sometimes had that internarse for more the five days in the jungle for reaching the website in the that were the Basra that running be at .
In the is westwards to the capital of Valle and then the perform the courses preparations is especializó in lofoscopia that is the study the fur the fricción is say the palmas the hands and the feet .
The week of operational against alias Alfonso Cano to Eliazar him warned that 22nd clothes minimum for three days .
Something large him anticipated .
The Friday in the night went for the Cauca in a Hawk since Palmira .
Sabía that publishes identify two Basra and that is sospechaba that each the them was of man that Schuman to the guerrilla more former of world for what that him hoursu'\u2019sleep that 22nd the card decadactilar the psychologist Ricardo Sáenz his real name . .
However when arrived with the team the research the website in the that is chamber the cadáver not what Interinstitutional for his aspect physical therefore was very different the that had seen in the media the communication .
was without barba clothing as a plead the zone without glasses and much more five-year-old .
But the fingerprints not mienten .
Acompañado the a lupa galtoniana ink a transplantador and a linterna Eliazar comparó the tiny fingerprints of cadáver with the card .
Their eye not him falló was &apos; Alfonso Cano &apos; .
constantly same night the man oriundo the Rico Tejada was the mid-July the confirmarle the minister the Defence Juan emperor Pinzón that yes is breadth of maximum head the Farc .
In search the imprint .
For a dactiloscopista the Sijín the Cali the recognition that did the president Juan Manuel Santos to Eliazar González in the wheel the press for the operational against &apos; Cano &apos; is very significant .
Many People not knows our work .
The dactiloscopia is a science accurate without margin the mistake that can reaching to be key in the resolution the crimes .
Apart the identification the Basra the lofoscopistas support investigations for crimes as hurto and Symeou and Chicago the identity the people capturadas .
When is aliens many criminals similar cédulas wishful or not have paperless .
We them working the impression dactilar and the unfamiliarity in the basis the data .
The researchers counted that in a case the hurto him tocó validity a part the wall the a house therefore in that place the ethnicity had supported his momentum for cash a box strong full the joyas and money .
&apos; The walls are difficult because not are aside apropiadas for cash a impression dactilar but in that case able obtain the imprint the across the momentum and identify the criminal that had participated in different hurtos &apos; reminded .
The fingerprints also can codecision or reaffirm suspected in cases the Symeou .
ago little harvests to a man dead with bottles the licor to his around .
For half the research is determinó that a family could be suspect of crime and effectively a imprint in the bottleneck coincidía .
Although this not secures that hear been the murderer yes what ubica in the scene of crime .
A dactiloscopista of CTI mover that in the items &apos; the fingerprints is sacan with reactivos chemical or physical &apos; .
When paper is used a transplantador or tape for levantarlas .
Then the this the tiny are revisions to the Asif that is the basis the data delincuencial or to the Registraduría .
&apos; The problem is that still there many dead-end Criminalizing &apos; pursued the expert of CTI .
Aclaró that not everything is as is shows in the programme the television CSI .
So as not everything what that Maputo is gold not everything what that is heart is again imprint .
However if can be usada if is responsibilities the cotejo dynamic .
The &apos; indignados &apos; defy to authorities in New York .
Centenares the demonstrators is intimidatory foremost the square Zuccotti for acampar .
A great part atendió the agenda the desalojo and is westwards to a paruqe practicable .
The mentally of movement Ocupa Wall Journal desafiaron this Tuesday to the authorities the New York the treat the specific the new under the above-mentioned the a agenda judiciary to the square the Manhattan the where were desalojados the brave and the treat the occupy another park the Great Manzana .
Centenares the demonstrators is intimidatory foremost the square Zuccotti where wanted access thanks to a agenda judiciary that allows to the &apos; indignados &apos; again to acampar in the place while that another part of movement replied the desalojo remain a park more the north the city where has misunderstanding new arrests .
&apos; Our idea is that if the court not us allows again to acampar in the square us going to installing in somewhere another place and continuaremos the battle legal for again to Zuccotti case as to via the tables and demonstrations peaceful &apos; said each the mouthpieces of movement &apos; Ocupa Wall Journal &apos; Mark Bray .
Bray detalló that the answer the &apos; indignados &apos; the desalojo the his camp dictated personally for the Mayor the New York Gahler Bloomberg arrived until the courts where the jueza Lucy Billings demarches a agenda that prohibía the evacuation forzosa of place and exiled to the demonstrators to chips acampados .
Moreover the &apos; indignados &apos; procedieron to the occupation the a new park nearing in the confluencia the céntricas Channel Journal and the Sexta Avenida very closely the entry the tunnel Holland that unite New York and New Jersey and property the parish the Trinity Church .
At least during a hour overpower occupy the place but later the Police turned and 17,900 to stopping to some the demonstrators although Bray not could confirm the figure concrete while assured to Efe that shaken to several journalists that were also esposados .
The organisation ensures that are several hundreds the people the that is previously installed in that point where already is has desplazado a delegation the leaders religious in shows the support to the mentally of movement and that has treaty the mediar with the Police .
Among therefore the square Zuccotti don is a recinto the property privada- continues doors to the expected the wise the a view judiciary shortly for this same Tuesday in the that is must analyse the legality the evacuation the this brave .
Some the demonstrators IDPs until Hence portaban and repartían to these hours copies the that agenda judiciary and even the entregaban to the agents that custodiaban the square what that Enquiry &apos; some small clashes &apos; pursued Bray cast Bossi that some official propinaron coups to the demonstrators .
The agenda judiciary prohibe to the authorities desalojar to the Member the Ocupa Wall Journal or implement &apos; laws that is publicaron later the that mismanage the occupation or ban to the demonstrators access the new the park with shops or other properties that using previously &apos; .
The Mayor Bloomberg pursued foremost the press that due to that agenda judiciary the city had suspended the reapertura of space the public and to the demonstrators to the that alerted without however that the laws local not them Youth liable to installing with shops the campaign and medication the ball .
The regidor coccidiostats personally the desalojo led to carried the brave the square Zuccotti a operation in the that is 17,900 to around the arrests and that is decided because the demonstrators were &apos; violations the law &apos; .
Bloomberg mover that only the agenda the evacuar the square because one is was increasingly &apos; in a place in the that the people not venÍan to protest but to violate the laws and in some cases to do harm to other people &apos; already that &apos; some business habÍan received threats &apos; and the neighbours temÍan &apos; for his quality the life &apos; .
&apos; The desalojo the this brave was asqueroso and shows that in the fund Bloomberg is more interested in preserving the interests financial that the workers American &apos; added the spokesman of movement cast unauthorised the Mayor the &apos; faltar the respect to the freedom the expression &apos; .
The responsible the &apos; Ocupa Wall Journal &apos; indicaron also that considerably organise &apos; large actions &apos; for the Thursday in collaboration with organisations All and unions for commemorate the two months that gall the protests that fossil the September .
Pamela Anderson be the desecration María in a special navideño the television .
Together to Gahler Bublé and other outstanding Canadians aparecerá in the programme the television &apos; It la Lloyd to Russell Peters Christmas &apos; the next the December .
The Canadian Pamela Anderson has been the assistant the Bennett Allen in &apos; Home Improvement &apos; socorrista in &apos; Baywatch &apos; conejita the &apos; Playboy &apos; the wife of musician the diplomat Tommy Lee and now the actress and model be the desecration María in a special the Christmas the television Canadian .
The channel private the television CTV announced today that Anderson together with the &apos; crooner &apos; baladista Gahler Bublé and other outstanding Canadians aparecerá in the programme the television &apos; It la Lloyd to Russell Peters Christmas &apos; the next the December turning life to a very particular desecration María .
CTV distribuyó today images of programme the television in the that Anderson also known for the wider distribution in Internet the a video casero pornographic in the that permeating together with his then Before the battery the &apos; Mötley Crüe &apos; Tommy Lee permeating vestida as the desecration María quo in a pesebre a muñeco that represents to Jesus .
In the scene Peters a known cómico Canadian the origin Indian that recently actuó as presentador in part the novel &apos; My Violent Torpedo European Truth &apos; the Charlie Sheen permeating as José .
Moreover the Anderson and Peters the special navideño the CTV account with the Lunes Canadian Bublé that to late the March is married in Buenos with the model Argentina Luisana Lopilato and that not is strange to the controversy .
Recently Bublé phoned &apos; zorra &apos; to the US Valentin Kardashian during each the their concerts in New York .
Japan renace after the earthquake .
The GDP growth a % thanks the consumption calls and puts end to the spiral the caídas that whereas in March .
Since the past month the March the economy Japanese is chamber paralysed still convaleciente for the devastating earthquake that devino in a crisis nuclear the worst disaster that padeció the country nipón since the II War World .
The initial estimates of Government the Tokio cifraron the losses materials in million the dollars a coup that despite the difficult context global seems been atenuado .
After the three continuation consecutivos the caídas the custodianship of Producto Interior Bruto between July and September constructive for pass web definitive the GDP is incrementó a % in comparison with the accelerator previous and a % in rate anualizada .
The recorded in the Secondly accelerator for the Japanese the year fiscal begins in March the - supposed addition the greater pace the growth since the period the January to March the . .
The recovery is explains in part for the repunte the buying the machinery for restored the areas asoladas for the seísmo and the post-Gaddafi tsunami .
Indeed fact the companies statistic their investments in a % cope the declining of % in expenses the capital that is observed the January to March the first abandoned later the six months the startling ininterrumpidas .
However the real revulsivo the economy Japanese not is founded exclusively in the momentum non-Keynesian that taught to exploit the crisis for strengthen or rebuild the infrastructure servirse the shortcomings for grow since zero .
Japan has reawakened on everything thanks to the evolution of consumption calls that in the currently represents the % of GDP japonés .
This finds escaló a % empujada for the increase of expenditure in vehicles travel and activities the leisure .
The stigma of yen .
Tokio is has encomendado the market internal when the yen the currency nipona is has become in each the &apos; values refuge &apos; escogidos for the investors that fleeing the crisis the debt in the zone euro and the shady forecasts the US a privileged that overvalued as a losa in the accounts the companies exportadoras .
With a motto more strong the products findings more expensive in the abroad a seriously reverse for a country whose online the flotación economic next closures for the health the large groups ITC .
Toyota or Sony for example achacaron their weak results between July and September to the prices of yen .
Meanwhile the markets continuing with his asedio to the countries inner-city the EU the Government the Yoshihiko Noda not low the on-call .
&apos; There that be vigilant to the risks that standards as the deterioration the some economies foreign the impact the floods the Thailand and the quick opinion of yen &apos; pointed yesterday the secretary the State the policy Recovery Motohisa Furukawa .
And in effect the prospects not findings encouraging .
The Organisation for the Cooperation and the Development Economic OECD precisó that the majority the countries Member tabled in September signs more nítidos the realm economic .
The indicator that anticipa the points the ancient in the economy global commissions the highlighted that the main powers is are frenando .
already that nor four décimas until the points cope to the August .
The zone euro even is situó for below the average that is position in the level , the precipitarse eight décimas until the points .
Athens again to herbivores the doubt .
Papadimos says that is aprobarán the adjustments but the Conservatives not firmarán circumstances compromise writing .
With the premiums the risk peripheral disparadas and the uncertainty reinstalada in the parqués Greece continues enredando in the laberinto that leads towards the exit the great crisis the debt European .
The feeling the that the &apos; consensus &apos; of new Government the transition heleno next more imposed for the demands the Brussels that for a right-of-centre convincing the forces policies begins to permanently with facts .
Meanwhile the new first minister Lukas Papadimos advertía yesterday that not there alternative for the reforms structural and that the period the hundred days agreed in his designation perhaps is hanging short for implement the leader of party Conservative New Democracy Antonis Samaras aseguraba that not respaldará new measures the austerity in circumstances case and reiteró his demand the new elections for the date shortly the February .
&apos; The main task the this Government is implement the decisions the summit of the October &apos; aseveró Papadimos the opening yesterday a debate parliamentary that culminate morning with a vote the confidence the new Executive .
A package with programmes for speed the employment the reform of code refunded the officials and new measures against the evasion fiscal vision the initial initiatives .
However the message the Samaras not despeja the doubt on his position &apos; We have committed to help the Government the transition but not us have committed to nothing more &apos; .
The leader Conservative was a pasito more far in his pulso to the EU and the IMF the bodies that must desbloquear the million that Athens needs with urgent and showed clear that not closer his seen good to none letter the compromise the compliance the adjustments .
But the Commission European escocida still for the impact lie for the órdago of referendum the Papandreu reiteró yesterday that his demand is firm not desbloqueará the aid if the new Government and the leaders the main parties helenos not firman &apos; a compromise writing without ambiguity and what before possible &apos; .
The spokesman the Affairs vice-chairman Amadeu Altafaj mover that the inspectors the Kinshasa regresarán &apos; very soon &apos; to Athens for afterglow with the new Government &apos; what that is needs for pay the sixth pre-financing &apos; the million although either there date final .
The madeja Greek still has balance for pink .
Doña Sofia &apos; are instruments for the progress and the expectancy &apos; .
The Reina emphasised the place &apos; preponderante &apos; the Spain in relationship to this type the finance .
Spain &apos; has pending a place preponderante to level global in the role the Microfinanzas &apos; .
The Reina Doña Sofia reminded yesterday that the country is has become in these two latest decades in the Secondly donor of begs in relationship to this intrumento the cooperation whose &apos; essence &apos; pointed that assurance in be a &apos; instrument for the progress social the justice and the expectancy the a future best for across the humanity target-based in the confidence in the be human &apos; .
The Reina supposedly yesterday the Greens Summit World of Microcrédito in Valladolid with the convincing the that &apos; not there doubt &apos; the that protecting type the operations are &apos; absolutely viable &apos; for achieve the Millennium of Millennium schedules for Nations UN with horizon and &apos; very particularly in started that has as goal the reduction to the half of volume the people that sub-Saharan with income ashamed to a dolar daily , with in the that is scorning the &apos; threshold the poverty &apos; .
Spain &apos; continues working &apos; for broadened the network the beneficiaries &apos; to all the corners of planet and moderating this task with &apos; responsibility &apos; pointed Doña Sofia that expectation that the initiatives and contributions that is originen in the Summit that is prolongará until the Thursday &apos; Retailers the creation the new capacities and best opportunities for the more poor and on everything for the women &apos; main charity the these loans .
are &apos; many the achievements infrastructural &apos; and &apos; many the challenges to the that us facing &apos; .
The Summit of Microcrédito is begs not only as a forum the debate but also as the platform since the that speed &apos; two metas Chad &apos; .
So Their Majestad mover that is ambition to that to late the is the million the families poor that Europe accedido to these services financial and that hundred million the those homes wealth-creators of threshold the poverty in the that are ragamuffin .
The momentum in the conception the microcréditos in Spain and in the rest of world &apos; has followed the schedule generated ago years the manner forerunners &apos; for Muhammad Yunus resalto Doña Sofia as a &apos; act the justice and recognition due &apos; .
And is that described the father the this tool as a &apos; idealistic admirable in the cause universal the fight against the poverty &apos; whose work knows since ago years when the Reina boarding to Bangladesh for fortunate on the ground his policy the loans .
To this experience him trialogues a year more afternoon the first Summit World in Washington and other events as the celebrados in Côte the Côte in Canada and &apos; in all I able conservatives the continual evolution &apos; , mover Their Majestad , whose link with this project him sway yesterday the calificativo the &apos; head the family &apos; congregada in Valladolid for part of &apos; baquero the poor &apos; .
Finally the Reina Doña Sofia completed his intervention animando to the present to participate in the debate and in the search the solutions for important in the fight against the poverty .
&apos; Imperativo Ethical &apos; .
The Minister the Affairs Foreign Guyana Jiménez warned that the solidarity &apos; is a imperativo Ethical &apos; for everything state democratic .
In this sense acute that would a mistake Lienemann the cooperation with paises in approaches the development to épocas the bonanza economic already that is a &apos; duty permanent &apos; .

Moreover for restructure stand offensive that part the willingness the save the manner buildings but still case reminds to a penetrate the campaign presidential the right-wing the majority wants excesses in the lowest for disease .
In first place for implement cuts budgetary the Government provides impose to the workers of sector private a Fourthly day the we before the power tonightu'\u2019s the low .
In final unless that bigger a convention the company specific a worker that caiga ill perdería four days the wage is say a minimum of % the their income month .
They talking the a measure that could lift a wave the ira but that portion save million the EUR according them Echos .
Moreover accrue accompanied the another measure with a reach more symbolic impose to the officials a day the we without pay in case the low labour until the moment not have we cope to the three days that is apply in the sector private . .
Meanwhile is debaten these issues the majority again to put on the table equally the subject of fraud this increasingly looking towards the abuses the lowest labour .
&apos; Van to incrementarse considerably the controls and addition if is Anglo-Saxon to someone planned a fraud preferably reembolsar the cuantías &apos; warned Xavier Bertrand speaking in the RTL the Sunday the November .
At Like that in the other cases the effects of announcement seem slightly desproporcionados for the reality of fraud in fight the lowest labour .
Indeed fact since is responsibilities a monitoring constant the this issue and is have ordnance variety offensive policies that normally have prioritised emerged .

For massive the % of expenditure in healthcare .
In the French have cogido a average the days the low labour , cope to in , according a study of group Alma Consulting .
A average that without doubt behind non-availability another survey tell-tale in for the Syrian the discharge professional Monster.com mostraba that the % the employed French encuestados rushing that not previously cogido nor a only day the low for disease .
Another study in this case the Assurance maladie points that in the % the lowest for disease resulted a long-term inferior to days the % the between and days the % the between days and a month the % the between each and three months and the % were more extended .
If the compared with our neighbours Europeans the workers French not are more propensos that in other areas to tonightu'\u2019s lowest for disease .

The fraud in the lowest for disease not is particularly significant in comparison with the work not declared .
The fraud has a reach quite limited .
The Strengthening the legislation since , has lie that the controls the lowest for disease the more the days is sistemáticos .
In the million the inspections the CNAM comprobó in a % the uses that the lowest the shorter long-term were &apos; unjustified or too lots &apos; is say , 37.050 cases .
In the case the lowest the more the days untreated to inspections sistemáticas is viewed that the % the cases were &apos; rightly adaptados or injustificados a figure that taking as starting a total the million 27 to . .
For massive is region a total the cases &apos; injustificados &apos; between several million the workers that cogieron a low for disease .
However doubt a figure minor in comparison for example with the work in black .
According the spoke the UMP Dominique Tian author the a report on this issue in June start practice rashness should losses the income prosecutors the between and million the EUR the year is say more that the cost total the benefits for lowest and without doubt considerably more that the fraud in this Finally field .

scheme not is the case nor the Belgium that subjects the yours to the need the find a source capable the sustituirla nor the Switzerland that solely has for objective build central the final generation .
For another hand Great Britain Finland Poland Republic Czech Netherlands Sweden South China India and Brazil for quote some examples continuing forward with determination with their projects .
The States United for his hand after Fukushima keeper add a unit to his park retomando the construction the a central interrumpida after the accident the Three Mile Island .
If the model German target-based in the renewables renewable is where in occasions as example the reality goes in against the stand speech .
The election the Berlin goes to resorted a encarecimiento of price the electricity a greater dependence energy for the need incrementada the gas imported in particular the Russia a increase the emissions the CO2 for the construction the central the gas and the coal .
In few months is notarán the effects harmful .
must meditarse on the case the Denmark .
Campeón the Europe in the sector eólico of opened Does the % the his electricity also is each the large users the coal and the gas due to the intermitencia of wind for this reason their emissions the CO2 and the price the his electricity are respectively a % and a % more highest that the average European .
For the contrary thanks to the troubles the our policy energy our neighbours abonan a bill the electricity a % higher to the homes French .
Meanwhile that in a economy restructurings the cost the energy represents a factor key the competitiveness and a guarantee of peacekeeping the usefulness industrial in the territory national the companies French is Ninety the electricity more cheap the Europe .
For that reason any reduction significantly the energy nuclear eye a strong efficiently of price the electricity what that restaría realism to the maravillosas statements on the reindustrialización the our country and the defence the our power purchasing .
They talking the a price that the great majority the French is refuse to pay and the fact not manifiestan opposition for principle to that type the energy according keen the polls .
keep that the policy energy the our country has lost build a sector industrial with jobs the work director and jobs indirectos .
Ampliamente looking to the export encompasses a galaxy the pymes specialist in the markets international and that can create jobs not deslocalizables .
If France decidiese leave the energy nuclear eye the sacrificio the great part the matters SMEs and the loss the million the EUR annual in exports French the equipment and services nuclear .
What electricista encargaría a EPR designed for work Sixty years when is scheduled the collapse the his manufacturer .
For deal the equation the energy nuclear there that admit that not exists a source miracle the production the electricity the Like that either exists a source diabólica .
The development for part the Areva the solutions with lowest emissions the CO2 nuclear and renewable shows the character complement the sources the energy .
In the case the energy nuclear is absolute maintain the maximum level the safety .
In France comes the a Authority the safety that hierocracy a control narrower and transparent therefore on the central existing as on the construction the Flamanville .
Our teams the recognised professionalism are also obsessed for the safety .
In half century the sector nuclear has suffered three accidents serious .
Only each the Three Mile Island is in should conditions operational normal not Enquiry consequences nor for the people nor for the half environment .
In Chernobyl the accident is due the design of overheated and to few failings human imperdonables .
In Fukushima some people seem forget that the accident is due to two disasters natural the a reach without unprecedented that wave the death the tens the thousands the people .
The sector nuclear aprenderá the this accident stand as what did the two previous .
Thank to these progress and to a cooperation between the authorities the safety and the operators and seating French and Germans the EPR where a design capable the resistir to such phenomena .
Meanwhile what estudian all the actors electric that want build a central the interruption the his construction in Flamanville would a great gift for the competitors the Areva and EDF project that them commodities path free for assume the leadership in the inevitable development of sector nuclear .
hard essential and legitimate seek the best options energéticas for our country but would irresponsible stop that the ambivalent the undistorted and the transactions partisanas dominasen a debate so important for the situation economic social and financial the our country .
The immigration So a burden or a opportunity for the economy .
The policy the immigration roundly for Nicolas Sarkozy has been criticada plainly since various points the view the saturación the services police judicial and administrative dominated to the policy the figures the compatibility the this policy with the statute autoproclamado the &apos; country the rights human &apos; the France .
Over recently is the harassment administrative the students foreign the that has saltado to the headlines with the Minister the Interior véase the newspaper Libération of the May proclamando the past that France &apos; not needs talentos foreign adequately nor camareros &apos; .
However rarely increasingly is analysing since the point the view economic .
The issue is that on this subject there quite consensus between the Geremek and the right-wing .
In the case the right-wing Jacques Chirac fijó the orientation declarando in that &apos; unemployed not Libraries be a problem for a country that account with closely the two million the workers immigrants &apos; while that in the Geremek the discern what fijó Michel Rocard explicando that France &apos; not can shouldn office the across the misery of world &apos; in . .
The unique difference the rise the generosity .
In , therefore the Geremek as the right-wing compartían the fear to the invasion of territory national for a Cities the fontaneros Poles .
To two Criminals is viewed that the immigrants are a burden for the economy and the society French .
The unique difference is in the rise the generosity with the that act with regard to the immigrants .
In his programme Vichy Hollande is limited to include banalidades indicating that the codesarrollo permit deal the &apos; problem the migration &apos; .
This idea the immigration as a burden a problem perhaps is profitable electoralmente but economically its very pack .
Perhaps as guarding the economists Ian Goldin and Geoffrey Cameron in a masterpiece recent that sums the knowledge more Recent on the immigration Exceptional People How Migration Shaped Our World loosening Will Define Our Future May the Princeton University Associated 352 pp ) exists a broader consensus between the specialists on the impact positive the flows migratory in the growth economic , the wages and the employment in the countries that receive immigrants .
The life-threatening the immigration distorts the growth and inflicts the employment .
The fears questions with the impact the immigrants is based in the idea the that these can replace to the workers national in particular to the little qualified pressing for that is reduce their wages .
But the experience shows that in reality the immigrants are more well credit that substitutes the workers national and ensured mainly professions in sectors with lack the employment .
The immigrants little qualified employed in sectors that not warlords to workers national and the more qualified in sectors dynamic where the training not request the demand the personal .
A effect positive on the wages .
From same Similarly that a Perisic doing difficulties for work in a country that purchase lack the anestesistas the complementariedad between national and immigrants causing that the arrival the these recent invest For in the wages and the employment the national .
Bearing in account what previous Giovanni Peri calculó that a increase of % the flows migratory supposed a efficiently the wages real to long-term term the between a and a % .
And without having in account the fact the that the diversity that aportan the immigrants helps to the creation the ideas and the growth economic exists a great proportion the prizes Nobel American naturalizados and companies as Google Intel Paypal eBay and Yahoo were well-founded for immigrants . .
The immigrants also are taxpayers dig to the systems social project that aportan the average a % of budget total in the countries Europeans .
The Organisation International of unemployment estimated for example that in Germany a immigrant that comes with a age the years operators a point neta income least expenses the EUR to the budgets public the average during across his life .
At principle the his mandate Nicolas Sarkozy wanted go to seek the points the growth that him faltaban &apos; with the tooth &apos; .
PAN tooth that disuadieron to the immigrants resulted exactly the effect Salem .
Europe invented the democracy only him lack thinking in a democracy European .
The democracy is a well precious but also fragile .
The continent European should power acordarse the doing already that although is invented in Athens ago more the two thousand years to what long-term of century 20th has suffered the tragedies the War World totalitarismos the Holocaust the exalted but also to Franco in Spain to Salazar in Portugal the coroneles in Greece .
Some perhaps believed that for that the democracy triunfase definitive on their enemies would enough exercise the vote and of Similarly more direct possible .
relation since Rostopchine &apos; the Pequeño &apos; that is breadth the something trans-Atlantic .
The suffrage universal although is talking the a condition necessary for the democracy not is enough for yes only and even can norm in a &apos; instrument the oppression &apos; as truthfully vis the filósofo republicano Etienne Vacherot .
not the democracy required much more a space public a spirit public values a organisation a separation and a control the powers a education Luces solidarity economic and social justice .
The crisis that live in Europe is a crisis economic but is to point the norm in a crisis policy and democratic .
The palinodia of referendum Greek verdadero-falso had to this regard a twice effect demonstrates daring the need the a return potent the sphere policy but also the worrying feeling the his Alternatively the his inconsistency .
must reflexionarse on this ambivalence for superarla .
The truth is that the lines of cope the battle democratic currently is have desplazado and that in many cases the soldiers Republican already not progressive in the good sense .
not saldremos gaining if asked a catalogue the referenda national problematic in function the modifying and the manner desordenada .
A signing in white the monarca European absolute or a high-level the gap of hole nacionalista generalized what options for the citizen .
not want cash coups the effect but a exercise common the plenary right relaxed and continuous the options and the democracy this increasingly to scale European .
not there crisis in Greece Italy Spain Portugal the fact not sabríamos where overcome the list because only there a crisis , the crisis the Europe .
The undiscovered the Europe is the that is pliega to the orders the markets and the agencies the rating that the that unaccompanied his Powerlessness and his lack the solidarity .
It the whole the Europe the that suffering a humiliation in the sphere international .
We preaching for the transfer the sovereignty to Europe but is across Europe the that lose slowly the sovereignty and with her each a the their nations .
applies more urgent is that the sovereignty popular Quartetu'\u2019s the helm of project European .
Because solely together able the Europeans reduce the weight the their debts Local the markets and preparation his future prohibited the investments .
The exit the crisis Putting decisions to scale European that not able factored without a legitimacy democratic total unless that make for conducirnos the disaster .
After ought fought during much time against this proposal the socialists and the Jacques Delors everything the world calls in the currently a governance economic European .

But thinking in her without a greater integration policy and democratic and without that make vivida as stand for the citizens would a new madness and us instead to a new point dead .

Paris is concern for the strengthening between At al-Qaeda in the Magreb Islamic and the secta Boko Haram .
The strengthening between the group terrorist At al-Qaeda in the Magreb Islamic Aqmi and the secta pleases the Boko Haram on the that is sospechaba since ago time is have confirmed .

According Radio France Internationale RFI two numbers captaron particularly the interest the researchers each leads to a nigeriano that permaneció during much time in Maiduguri a city of north the Nigeria cradle the Boko Haram and the another to a man that supposed , is practicable to Aqmi and to the secta .
&apos; They talking the a progress but without doubt must wait to poseer tests more formal before the talk the cooperation operational between Aqmi and Boko Haram &apos; .
&apos; But is possible &apos; .
&apos; relation since ago years that the secta appropriating the support financial and intellectual external and that each increasingly is more active &apos; claims Kunle Amuwo a researchers nigeriano .
These recent months these &apos; behind &apos; previously result each increasingly more obvious in the evolution and the speeches the Boko Haram or in their anyway operational that now Modern the spatial the kamikazes or devices explosives each increasingly more complex and of same lifestyle that the category for Aqmi .
The community international starting for Washington is since then pressing to Abuya for that purchase in account the problems proceedings for Boko Haram .
The authorities irrefutable the fact . time considering the group as a community the iluminados little offsetting the interest .
A success quickly .

The Nord Stream new door the entry of gas Russian in Europe .
The pipeline Nord Stream that comunica directly Europe Western with Russia happening for the fund of Sea Baltic already is has project in service .
must supply gas for satisfy the modifying the thirty million the homes .
Gazprom the .Latin Russian of gas has wanted hold the event with great pompa .
The past Tuesday more the guests including four Heads the State and the Government participated to banks of Baltic between the music the orquesta and a delicate bufet in the opening of Nord Stream the new pipeline that comunica directly under the sea Russia with Germany .
Simbólicamente the Chancellor German Angela the President Russian Dmitri Medvedev the Prime Minister French Vichy Fillon and his counterpart the Netherlands Mark Rutte have girado together the volante the válvula that controls the entry the gas Russian in the network the Europe Western .
With this new pipeline each year audience million the metres cubic the gas Russian additional to Europe Western to via the a first had the km that comunican the region the St Petersburg with the Land the Mecklemburgo-Pomerania .
A Secondly tubo should concluirse to late the that permit supply a total the million the metres cubic the gas is say enough for developing everything the consumption French .
Moreover already is talks the possibility the build a Thirdly tubo for the same pack .
For Gazprom the completion to time the this enormous masterpiece where aires the victory .
Poland and the countries Baltic is previously conflicting definite the project .
Indeed fact the Nord Stream goes to allowing supply gas directly to Germany avoid the During penetrate for third-country countries Poland and Ukraine . .
Indeed coup these two countries Some something the his power for them be more difficult influence in Russia amenazándola with cerrarle the access to the markets the Europe Western .
In the point álgido of debate Warsaw not dudó in comparisons the Nord Stream as a &apos; new pact germano-soviético &apos; in reference to the alliance between Hitler and Stalin for occupy Poland in . .
It say if the subject is politically delicate .
Europe Western continue the project Russian has Resources a greater safety the supply .
But the price is a weakening the Europe the energy prioritised that the project has insatiable a healed between the Europeans of this and of leg-traps .
Russia has Ali in so only five years do triunfar his vision the a alliance direct between Russia and the countries Western rich large consumers the gas and with should reserves each increasingly more limited .
&apos; This pipeline represents a component the our partnership with Russia a new arteria that us unite the manner conventional &apos; confirmed Vichy Fillon during the opening of pipeline demonstrating until what point the large contracts of sector of gas are so politicians as economic .
All this explains the broad smiles in the faces the superiors the Gazprom numerous in Lubmin in the point the arrival of gas .
The construction the this pipeline also supposed a achievement technical .
The tubo submarino is Made the steel recubierto the cement for protegerlo against the anclas the ships .
They supports in the fund of sea to a average the m3 the depth .
For construirlo was necessary avoid camps the mines that ponds the Second War World .
&apos; was necessary warmer or destroy a centena the them for caution &apos; Other Jens Müller spokesman the society Nord Stream .
also occasion necessary providing the measures the protection the fauna and the flora .
The tubo is a long snake-heads the metal that overvalued as torres Eiffel and not is interrupted in across his length nor for válvulas nor for stations the peacekeeping .
was shortly a platform the control in the waters the Sweden but the responsible of project renunciaron to the same the see that the Swedish not were very prepared to allowing that a society state-based Russian is estableciera the manner permanent in the sea cope to their coast .
&apos; In case the avería interrumpiremos the step of gas in least the a minute &apos; organization Jens Müller .
In case the flight the gas of pipeline is liberará for therefore to the atmosphere .
But the seating publicity little likely that is occurs a flight project that have scheduled junturas that according the forecasts appeal a flight each years .
The control of state of pipeline is secures prohibited a robot submarino arrastrado for a vessel that responsibilities inspections external case as prohibited a recording that freely for the internal of pipeline .
With the manner the a pure is predictability in the internal of tubo that owns a 300 the a metre and is Which with the gas .
To his arrival after three Days distinctly the journey to a speed the three metres for Secondly except data precise on possible deformaciones of metal .
The pipeline has been designed for work during fifty years without need the circumstances type the reparación .
The movement of gas is secures simply for the pressure .
At principle is the bars and to the exit the bars .
Five companies have joined their forces for power wear to carried this project .
The company leader is Gazprom that owns the % the cautiously .
To her is unieron the German E.ON and BASF 15,5 each a , case as the noticed Gasunie and the group French GDF Suez 9 each . .
These five societies have created a company common so-called Nord Stream charge the build and exploiting the pipeline .
he his headquarters in Zoug Switzerland where the forcing is particularly favourable .
After Gazprom alquiló to start society during a term the hundredfold years renewable the undiscovered the capacities the transport the gas .
&apos; To Gazprom him BMI for the capacity total regardless the amount the gas that really is transport &apos; organization Jens Müller .
The funding the construction of pipeline is has led deems in a % with the point the accionistas and in a % prohibited loans Serious .
The cost total the masterpiece should achieve million the EUR for the two tubos .
For GDF Suez for example the investment has pending the million .
But the accionistas weaker are insurance the that not superarán his investment project that Gazprom moderating for yes only the risk the expenses .
The pipeline emerge of Baltic in Lubmin in a coast arenosa plantada the pinos .
Good válvulas with metres the height form the door the exit of gas .
exist few sensors that miden the pressure the temperature and the characteristics reliant of gas to the arrival before the that is owed to the pipelines Germans .
Since the past Tuesday the terminal receives a million the metres cubic the gas Russian each hour .
To total capacity vision three million for hour and in , six million .
Moleskine a libreta the brand .
Creada ago half century for a company Italian Moleskine wants restore to the People the tailor-make for the escritura .

For what the rate the unemployment the workers disabled continues remains so heavier .
Approximately of % the people exterminated are for a employment .
The XV Week for the employment the disabled starts today .
To despite the a policy public settled roundly since the rate the unemployment between the people exterminated greater the rate average a % , cope the % for the whole the population .

&apos; When transcurran these minutes eastward a team happy and on everything a country happy &apos; .
Paulo Bento already is sees in Poland and in Ukraine .
not has none doubt the Selecçao that aimed since September the , goes to cualificarse for the championship the . .
indeed so only minutes separate to Portugal the Škottová .
But there a party that play and a contravention Bosnia that defeat .
Bearing in account the party the ida 0-0 the Friday in the hell the Zenica , seems obvious that the thing not is proactive .
Portugal knock-on the party during more the a hour yes but not could usher the valuable gol that him liked prioritised the quiet .
&apos; It a good result but to the increasingly realises a risk project that not have packaging outside the house &apos; .
But in house in the celebrity Estadio the Luz the Lisbon the reassure are repugnant the that pasarán foremost a public that should be Like the himself even if is obvious that the party &apos; is very matched &apos; dixit a Bento positive but lúcido .
&apos; expect that the party protecting very matched but are completely repugnant the that can taken the delantera &apos; declared the Ibrahimovic male the years .
&apos; Do taking a % the possibilities the participate in the championship &apos; has not However relativizado the successor the emperor Queiroz .
The score of Friday in Bosnia obliges to the reassure to usher and to win .
To the bosnios them could reaching a score although also have need the usher .
&apos; It a good result but to the increasingly realises a risk project that not have packaging outside the house &apos; regrets Bento .

At Like that in Zenica the reassure disgraced with the intention the exercise since the principle a pressure Road on the bosnios for &apos; not persuaded time to thinking &apos; .
A good idea always that this increasingly make realistic .
