A strategy republican for hinder the re-election the Obama .
The leaders Republican justify his policy for the need the fight against the fraud electoral .
Now well the Centre Centre viewed this Finally a myth and claims that the fraud electoral is least prevalent in the States United that the number the people that die to cause the the fall the a glimmer .
Indeed fact the lawyers Republican not have met more that cases the fraud electoral in the States United in ten years .
A thing is certain matters new provisions Acting adversely to the rate the participation .
In that sense these measures measures in part the system democratic American .
At contrary the what that happens in Canada the states Americans are responsible the the organisation the the elections federal in the States United .
And in that same online a majority the the governments Americans banning to onwards the , new laws that Turning the process the register or the vote .
This phenomenon is has widespread after the elections the November the , that saw the increase the new representatives Republican in states .
In consequence during the year is introduced projects the law that tighter the exercise of right the vote in states .
The new laws electoral demand that the constituents jointly a document the identity with a photograph addition the a test the citizenship American .
For another part matters laws unemployed the periods the vote early-voting early-voting the right to names as Forrester in the day of polling and finance his right the vote to the citizens with record criminal .
Before the the elections the , circumstances state American immediately that the constituents constituents a document the identity with photograph .
The State the the was the First in demand .
The Court Supreme the the States United confirmed in the constitutional the the law the the .
For doing the authorities authorities is quick to women's that practice to other states .
In the recent years these authorities have supported projects the law in states for press to the constituents to submit a document the identity with photograph .
It important having in account that the contrary the what that happens in Quebec the citizens Americans not disposal the a document the identity universal as the card the the Security Social .
Indeed fact a % the the citizens Americans is say 21 million the people in age the vote not count with circumstances document the identity with photograph meantime for a agency officials the his state .
For another hand five million the new constituents in reproaches the a document the identity with matters characteristics .
But to often the obtaining of document the identity delays costs more the hundred dollars .
With what opened the new restrictions affecting the function disproportionate to the young the minorities and the people with income low .
In effect a % the the a % the people that earn least the dollars the year a % the the citizens the more the years and a % the the constituents the between and years not count with a document the identity with photograph .
And still there more .
In many states the students the constituents that more ignore to the candidates democrats not can use the document the identity with photograph meantime for his institution .
For another part those ourselves states authorise to the Member the the clubs the fishing or the hunting that usually vote to the parties Republican to use the documents issued for these clubs .
Before the circumstances state immediately the test the citizenship for vote .
Arizona was the first state in submit start demand .
Since , a dozen the states has adopted laws that demand that the constituents Suppliers that are citizens Americans .
These measures looking clearly limit the vote vote .
seems be that two the each three constituents constituents support the party democrat .
For another hand the legislators Republican supported in find laws that that the register the constituents the same day of polling in eight states .
Moreover constrained the right the the people and the groups to create a service the aid to the constituents that families names .
These restrictions have consequences .
For example in the elections broadly the , the campaigns the register the the constituents contributed the registration the around the million the citizens .
The measures actions since Reformation that the rate the register the new constituents liked in in comparison with the year . .
Moreover the legislators Republican adopted laws in other five states that shock the reduction of period the vote for advance .
For example in the elections the in Florida a % the the constituents that voted for advance were were while that these recent not represented more that a % the the constituents of state .
In the case the the the happening exactly what same .
These not represent more that a % the the constituents what that equivalent to a % the the citizens that ignore for advance .
However however the white that represent a % of electorate not represent more that the % the the citizens that ignore for advance .
For course the legislators democrats and their supporters is have conflicting desire to the adoption the laws that trade-restrictive the registration the constituents .
In this sense the governors democrats have blocked several projects the law .
The Ministry whatever the the States United intervened for trials the laws more controversial .
They could in part limit the damage .
For example so only the states adopted the law that immediately the presentation the a document the identity with photograph .
However however is undeniable that the new rules actions actions the exercise of right to vote in . .
The critical democrats Simitis the character partisan the the laws that is have voted already that is clear that with them is intended influence in the results the in the states key .
A report of Centre Centre the shows that the states that have adopted spoke laws represent the the votes necessary in the school electoral for achieve the presidency .
It too soon for Can with certainty if these amendments legislative to scale the system electoral appeal a impact significant in the results the the elections presidential the . .
A thing is certain matters new provisions Acting adversely to the rate the participation .
In this sense the measures measures in part the system democratic American .
American of cancer the prostate So Asking the Fishing or not apprising .
In effect the Fishing the PSA where in occasions results erroneous with false results negative or even false results positive after the that is decides perform speeches medical useless .
It a reason more that enough for do client to the men already already the for yes on if Libraries shouldn or not the tests the detection .
Asking the Fishing or not .
have asked advice to two specialists .
In the studies uses in the States United is affecting a great index the chlamydia between the groups the shows for what that is difficult interpret those data and do recommendations ground .
For his part the study European daring certain difference the mortality between the patients that is previously conducted the detection and the that not .
The study with a monitoring to the years proved addition that exists between the and the % the possibilities the infirm metastases if not is has conducted the Fishing the detection .
recommend for therefore the Fishing to onwards the the years or to onwards the the years if your father has suffered cancer the prostate .
The men the origin origin have a index the risk more high .
The key is taken a good decision a increasingly Previous the cancer .
There cancers aggressive and other cancers that are are .
It truly necessary achieve that the patient understands the rise the risk the his cancer They him must offer all the options possible and not necessarily treat the cancers the prostate that not contravention against the life to long-term term in whose case is must opt more well for a surveillance active the the disease .
Today in day many men to the that is them has Previous a cancer not are treaties project that said cancer not is anti-Polish nor passed a risk for his life .
In his place them suggesting a surveillance active the the disease and if one onus them offer a treatment .
treatment each increasingly with more often criteria precise for decide Who should or not be treaty .
recommend that is Please the Fishing in any case .
But is important that advisable with his doctor for determine if must shouldn the Fishing or not .
not has created in collaboration with the society International the the a tool that allows assess the pros and the pros of Fishing the PSA .
They can onto this document for the moment only in English but is offer translations inside the little in the next direction http http http http / / .
Prevention the disease .
Unfortunately not exists a recipe miracle for preventing the cancer .
To despite the the progress the the investigations the adoption the habits the life healthy continuing remains the best function the reduce the risks the suffer the disease .
eco-labelling that if everything the world world well and is asking what enough is could preventing a % the the cancers .
&apos; If nobody smoke that rate is accepted the least the % &apos; underlines underlines Genève spokesman the the society society against the Cancer .
In change change that around of % the the cancers are inherited .
Many other continuing remains completely explainable .
For the society society against the Cancer the fight against the smoking continues remains a priority to despite the the drop of number the smokers .
The tobacco is Sörensen with the % the the cases of cancer the lung .
It addition a factor the risk for other types the cancers .
props enormously the health the the people .
&apos; Today for today still there million the smokers in Quebec &apos; declared the spokesman spokesman Genève .
A custodianship hopeful motions years later the stop the smoking the risk the die the cancer is reduces to the half .
The weight .
The The and the obesity served also the emergence the the disease according the the .
the the risks the cancer the breast the bowel and the totally the bathing-water the the and the womb .
&apos; The investigations Studies that the practice regulate the activity physical during across the life protects against the cancer the breast &apos; Four .
The food .
The authority advised equally limit the consumption the poultry red .
In large quantities for ladder the risks the suffer a cancer Fighting .
The products the the also must avoided .
The preservation the the meat for his his fodder or delicious can provoke the training the substances carcinogenic .
&apos; may reputation the cells of authority and wear the development of cancer &apos; us non-smokers .
The minerals .
In the recent years several scientists have studied the strengthening between the complex vitamin and the cancer .
However however for the moment their investigations not are unconvincing .
unconvincing the the the studies onset the the Vitamin E are contradictory .
Meanwhile that in each the them is Overall a drop the the risks the cancer the prostate in another what that is observed was more well a increase .
The effect the the Vitamin D in the cancer either is has able determine with clarity .
For another part M. Genève emphasises in the importance the talk on the concerns and the record family the each each with his doctor .
&apos; Doing the Fishing the detection not causing cancer &apos; .
The The the the in detail .
The announcement of likely discovery of of the the resounding a great commotion the summer past and with reason .
They believes in effect that this this is involve of mechanism responsible the the mass the everything what that exists in the universe nothing more and nothing least .
And what that is more is talking the the the whose existence Unusual the model standard our best or &apos; least bad &apos; explanation the the nature and of behaviour the the fight that still not has been notice empirically .
But for the physical not is completely clear that is instrument the the .
relation without place to doubt that exists a new new and that is seems much the the the the predicted for the model standard .
Moreover new data data this week in a important conference the physical Portuguese in Kyoto seem confirm that yes what is although still missing more data for be completely insurance .
Indeed all ways assume that is talking the the already that the possibilities the mistakes seem few happens the what is talking .
There in this great world a law widespread and inevitable that involves that two things not can found in the same place the same time .
not there function the infringing that rule and not what best too because ready manipulating harm .
Although the physical the the particles make a world very complex is has demonstrated that also in her exists a law the these characteristics the principle the exclusion the the that stipulates that two particles not can occupy the same space the same time if are in the same &apos; state state &apos; a &apos; state &apos; that consists unity Similarly the some the their characteristics .
The physical Sensationalist the particles in two categories .
For a part us encountered with the good citizens scanners scanners that Amendments wisely the principle the the .
And for another are the the a laundry buffoons the the that not has respect for nothing or the least not for this principle what that mean that can found in the same place and the same time .
According the web website chosen chosen chosen the the the the that for true is extraordinary the the is earmarked in two groups the restaurateurs the the that not problems here and the &apos; particles the strength &apos; for the that the large forces the the nature is spreading and with the subjects the the the the excellent the some manner manner .
These These reflection underline here not are the the the that could believing .
Indeed fact if failure read this foretold is thanks to a a standpoint trivial the the or the &apos; &apos; the light &apos; that action as &apos; shoot &apos; the the strength electromagnetic .
In effect when a a with a burden electricity accelerated or changing the direction &apos; &apos; &apos; the camp camp in that emphasis environment a little as when gave a stone to a pond .
In this &apos; mess &apos; stems a wavelength electromagnetic the the light the the infrared the the optical etc and this wavelength not is another thing that a a is say , each the the the &apos; Without the strength &apos; .
&apos; more stable .
&apos;Madman what same with the the the the with the difference the that is talking the another camp the camp the the that needs be &apos; &apos; &apos; for that this this hang .
Now well the camp the the is regret more stable that the camp camp For For ago lack reaching to renewables extremely through a little as if is private the a pond Pisa in the that so only a rock rock catch varied for the surface .
For doing ago lack a relapse accelerator the particles as the the the megascience generalized the great great the the is a ring the km the circumference ) for achieve such levels the energy .
The analogy with the camp camp is a new tool that explains the relationship between the the and the mass .
Indeed fact not all the particles nor all the materials Pollution with the camp camp .
Some as the toy what for but other not a piece the role for example not is continue never for yes same grass-roots to the door the a freezing .
And the the same manner not all the particles Pollution with the camp the the the that what for have a mass while that the rest how the the for true , not the have .
Now well So what &apos; can proof &apos; all matters investigations , question the Madam Madam .
For the science this serves for verify the validity of model standard standard and allows addition , that the physical physical the differences between the comments and the predictions of of .
For his part many want desire that is trouble therefore the unemployed difference could opening a door to a &apos; new physical &apos; that that revealed holes of model .
This there that say has still enormous shortcomings as that not proposes explanation some relative to the seriousness generalized generalized ) or to the fight brown-skinned that constitutes around of % the the fight of universe generalized another another ) .
But not have met such differences in the megascience until the moment .
Impact .
The impact the spoke investigations in our day to day are difficult the predict but not create that us mistaken the say that not noon none .
For that won to medium-long the the years , the pioneers of infrared in the laboratories not not in absolute the revolution that their jobs jobs .
jobs the applications scientific but nothing more .
Indeed fact as already said the physical physical physical that worked in the laboratories laboratories where is invented the infrared in , and that named the first infrared continuous the first were were in , the principle the infrared was more well considered a &apos; aircraft the laboratory &apos; .
Imagine .
And addition the applications can also proceed the across the wider that surrounds to the research .
For example the same same same named a a the light in in the During the his research in fight the angles .
To despite the that not was in absolute his intention original this this serves now the &apos; eye &apos; for all the appliances digital of world what that him sway the Nobel the physical in . .
That not wants say for course that the activities of of organize necessarily so-called our lives but that never is knows .
Long-term palliative The best manner the die die Le Le .
In his Commission Commission in dignity Quebec bids recently the sensitive issue of end the the life .
The debate must joined soon while is prepares a project the law .
Now well inside the that dominance essential still there much that do .
Le Le has tried anybody the closely .
ago hardly should weeks the Mr Mr ironically only in his flat the the the .
The cancer the prostate that him was destroying him had prioritised a four-year the two years .
&apos; I previously prioritised five years the life but already wearing case seven &apos; tracing fact a passes passes in his bed in the centre the care palliative palliative the the to the that arrived the day previous .
&apos; But always is a shock not can be prepared for this &apos; continues .
The disease him has caused havoc a weakness enormous that him prevents go only the bathing and even feed for yes only .
only cope to a a lunch accepts resigned that him assist to feed .
feed arrives even to smile to talk with the strangers that him play attention him Practice medicines and him offered a bathing .
The courage the the death ordinary .
&apos; My greater desire is that me me the diarrhoeal is humiliating &apos; admits .
Good hours more afternoon the team reconstruct cure to that bad .
&apos; In the During the our lives projects that a man ago ago the ordinary &apos; tracing Pierre Pierre psychologist in the centre centre .
Back to his childhood for find people is a humiliation unacceptable .
&apos; That depends the the capacity the the person for accept that regression &apos; complaints .
Because according the opinion the the majority the the people that employed in care palliative the large moment have place in the heart same the that regression .
all the patients that Expenditure in the centre the care palliative palliative packet cancer .
They a prognosis the life maximum the three months .
In that state the team the doctors and nurses that them excessive already not offered the care &apos; curative &apos; .
The greater fear the the Mrs Pelinka the years is die &apos; restrictions and and &apos; .
But the disease him has fact compromising to their children .
&apos; I few good children &apos; adds .
&apos; already not me left more wishes in this life &apos; says before the accept that is him absurd a a for redouble to breathe .
And expected in the coming days a final visit the his son that lives in Italy .
In In is provides with a group the voluntary the care of body and aid to the food .
are care palliative that is them babies when not is can do nothing more .
For help to that his death make more more .
In Quebec accommodating with a bed the care palliative for each inhabitants .
It very little already that know that all an lay somewhere day .
Here the life continues in the best conditions possible explains the Lon Lon Lon a the the male of centre .
already make to level the comfort physical emotional or spiritual .
At At is him offered offered the mouths with brandy or or according the demand .
To the diabetics already not is them controls his rate the sugar .
The death manner part the what everyday .
Yesterday for the night him uses a beer the Mr X that died in the During the the night .
This morning his son is is the beer to the feet of Patriarch .
&apos; &apos; therefore to the patients as to their beings loved &apos; tracing Gevrij Gevrij verging the the care .
In the centre centre the days going without be never equal .
At hand the a man the years that that his final meeting family in the yard well sympathizer between their their while all intrusively to his health a young the years dies the manner tragic surrounded for their parents his woman and their two children after They tried everything for survive .
&apos; Since ago six months always there the three to five caged Top for people minors the years positively the cancer &apos; is are the Lon Lon Lon .
A % the the patients that are admitted in the centre centre next the his house and a % of hospital .
problem of access to care palliative .
A % the the Canadians simply not has access to the care palliative is say to the care weakened for alleviate the suffering when a ill arrives to the phase terminal the his life make in his home in the hospital or in a centre the care .
And several bodies as the centre centre and the society the care palliative to home of Cardiff Cardiff is is almost exclusively in the care the the patients with cancer .
It precisely that great we relative in the care health the Quebec what that ago that many doctors specialising in care palliative fisherwoman the adoption the a law that noise the euthanasia and the suicide attended .
Since the month the October a evident signed for for the the care palliative as the Dr Balfour Balfour and the Dr Shaw Shaw freely for demonstrate his opposition to stand initiative .
According the Lon Lon Lon the system health the Quebec not is what enough competent as for ensure that anybody purchase right to care palliative the quality before the that is accept proceed with the euthanasia .
&apos; Recently &apos; tracing &apos; I seen to a patient pass days in in suffering large aches without that is hear fact what necessary for relieve .
fear that the patients newcomer die only because not receive the care Will &apos; .
And parallel many many is is with their patients until the Finally day to despite the the worst prospects .
The hopes the survival the Hélène Richard were already under minimum when showed a treatment the chemotherapy exhausting .
&apos; When him spotted to my my that wanted stop the treatment her me said that him looked lot worth that like stop the fight &apos; tracing .
&apos; However however generalized her me had said that not had nothing more that do &apos; .
not there care care .
The Lon Lon believes that a % the the ill that dropped die grateful to their carers that not them Europe dealt in their demands a increasingly is them has relieved his pain thanks to a team the care palliative .
But there that say that the care palliative not are absolutely absolutely in what that Concerning the treatment of pain .
According According According verging the the care palliative to home the Cardiff Cardiff the patients not answer to the treatments against the pain in a % the the cases .
At final the the life the doctors usually resort to the sedating palliative that serves for ball the patient until the moment the his haemorrhaging already make the manner circumventing or the manner permanent .
not can pretend that not closing that part of suffering .
Every increasingly more the disease not reassured goes to having the possibility the having that sedating palliative .
The ill that not are are say all what same &apos; I want die &apos; .
But that not wants say necessarily &apos; want the euthanasia &apos; but &apos; want that me me &apos; .
The realisation the this Nature has been possible thanks to a scholarships the journalism the the institutes the research the health the Canada .
Canada rented the great generously in Quebec .
detailing the the network created employers of of collector the funds the parties politicians and specialists the the mafia Italian count day after day what that know the a frontier &apos; system &apos; of that form part the industry the the construction officials politicians unionists and landing .
A &apos; industry &apos; that went too expensive to the taxpayers natives on everything in the years and . .
&apos; hard remarkable how the system is is a increasingly have head-hunted to the large media &apos; &apos; Jacques Jacques spoke in Quebec and former head the the Police the Montreal .
dear dear the outbreak of scandal in that was possible thanks to a research to fund on the embezzlement compounded to contracts the roads in Quebec that the first minister liberal the that moment Jean Jean , not had consented more that in likeness .
The &apos; report report &apos; set a link direct between the industry the funding compelled the the parties and the corruption between officials .
&apos; Since the start the the research in so only the ministry the transport is would saved thousand million the dollars in contracts &apos; , analysing some the their violates the Missing with a part proportional .
The Commission Commission &apos; already has fact fall to two mayors &apos; adds while expected power reaching to &apos; demonstrate the ploys existing behind the the individuals &apos; .
A unit permanent corruption created in .
The Unit permanent corruption created in is applies also with his team the controllers , researchers and analysts of government .
This unit works addition the the policemen the &apos; the ill-defined ill-defined &apos; that since , have fact that the &apos; cartel of placing &apos; the Montreal is is to the hour the inflating contracts .
These latest weeks the unit has mortgage the registration in series the the accusations for fraud and corruption against charges municipal as Frank Frank and Richard Richard Mayor the a city the the stopped .
The next the the list would Savary Savary that ends the resign the his project the Mayor the Laval third city the Quebec .
They suspicion that is has has bombing bribery to change the contracts public .
They has accused formally to engineers the the network created the Montreal and to employers the origin Italian as Tony Tony and and and .
This Finally has caused commotion the explain to the committee the mechanics of &apos; system &apos; the obtaining the contracts public .
dear same cost during three years a % of value the the contracts gulf in Montreal to a broker bound to the mafia that that the money to dimension dimension the party of Mayor Mayor Mayor .
M. M. M. money to Behaviour and Behaviour during the years granting more the dollars Canadians few EUR to parties provincial , on everything to the Liberals in the power .
power equally ought organised a laptops the funds illegal for the the Minister liberal Gevrij Gevrij .
The inflation of cost the the contracts the placing .
In Montreal the &apos; system &apos; the corruption work with efficiency .
Savary Savary Savary the works public what mover perfectly foremost the committee in ten years received gifts invitations to travel travel the golf restaurants parties the Ice and bribery the companies of sector the the construction for a total the dollars everything doing to change the contracts the placing whose costs flair .
Other officials the the network created have admitted that received money for inflating the bills between a % and a % in concept the false extra .
Moreover a inflated of party of Mayor Martin Martin unauthorised to M. M. the ought fact the view blind deliberately to a budget parallel and I their coffers the money dirty .
To root the these revelations M. M. resigned to principles the November and subsequently to Montreal to a crisis enormous .
enormous enormous was a the the initial policies listened the Montreal that did sound the alarm .
As mayor-making of district the the in the this the the island is opposed since to the sale the a ground municipal distinct for million the dollars and and for million to the promoters in plenary boom estate .
The % of money the the campaigns electoral was money dirty .
Indeed the research that finally is Possibly to carried her ensures that remuneration &apos; the a balance for power understand the functioning of system system for for for stop the the and fishing to the guilty &apos; .
And adds that the process is &apos; painful but positive &apos; .
We holidays the injured but newspapers lack a unit the research clean in Montreal and be very vigilant for that the practices dubious not is repeated .
How do the cleansing .
cleansing .
Jacques Jacques for his part states that &apos; the officials have stolen hundreds the million the dollars &apos; but is is on everything for the role the the la &apos; politicians elected the aware the the ploy &apos; .
&apos; in a % the proportion the money dirty that is liquidity to the funding the campaigns electoral in Quebec Quebec &apos; me have said that that not is more that a watered-down parent the the reality &apos; .
The government government proposes limit to dollars the donations to parties but that not change the donation according him &apos; while not is Crucially strictly the expenses electoral will money dirty in the policy &apos; .
&apos; a review top-to-toe of system the fair the contracts public and the funding the the parties &apos; not can fall more under go the fund the the things with courage us permit rebuild the house with should foundations more solid with more controls and laws &apos; .
If this history pleasure the image international the Quebec and the Montreal M. M. taught to Especially that is laughing to include the mirror .
&apos; The The not is the Groningen Barcelona &apos; .
This season has distinct a new entity with the the .
How sensed that breakthrough .
They could explain for a decision-making the awareness individual but also for the new dimension of of .
They arrived large players .
players the day in day to his hand .
The personal technical also me has brought much .
And those elements me migration to daily to raising the level the my game .
In a party that is more easy .
All goes very quickly in the football .
But I not me me .
Since my medium-long in the centre the the the the the until my step for for always I moved to steps leaps .
task to obtain benefit the the competition competition for Carlo Carlo .
The recruitment the this summer are numbers to Perhaps parties the very high-level level .
that that each Invariably is crucial .
That ago that a player as I purchase dwell the fight and help everything .
For another part Carlo Carlo me provided much in As to my strengthen .
Has broadly for Along as Claude Claude that that in the same position that I .
I is the man that Widespread the team .
For course .
course disposition respect to all the technical .
Today for today not there nobody Like in the League and is between the best best Europeans .
he a great experience and has cattle numerous titles with the best clubs .
He worked with large players .
believe that is Possibly other titles in Paris .
In January had a conversation very comforting with him .
I coordinating the escape the a series the injury .
The confidence that has in me explains also my good performance .
What thinks on the the in the first part the the season .
In the League , Lyon us has taken the project the leader .
But still in the ambush .
One the our elderly objectives is the League the champions us have life-saving for the the the final with lifestyle .
What is the objective of club in this competition .
Are to treat the reaching what more far possible .
To onwards the now can pass any thing .
But have much that say cope to many and very good teams Europeans .
want for begin overcome the first the our Politically cope the Oporto for power receiving the presumably the the the final .
The The can norm in a great club European to short term .
already has the budget .
For norm in a great club European Paris has that win titles and be Hence to long-term term .
Today for today that not is the case .
To level economic the the is submitted to their media for that that project is constantly .
not win the glass in the League as in the final season , So banana a great failure .
For course would a great disappointment .
This year going to invest all our efforts in criminality that title the champions .
In the final season not enshrined far .
In May us We a disappointment already that back-up with the conditions privileged for abolish first .
Andersson a season strong .
coal with points .
usually with points should ought been champions .
But another team the the had a season quite best .
This year believe that be the good .
Even if the large teams as the Marseille the Lyon and the Bordeaux fighting for the title believe that accommodating with the weapons for for .
Do that the media expect more of of .
It normal that fares much the us if world in what that is has investments in the players that have .
applies have accepted completely .
After the that that in house to to that still is trouble with things that absence is a little frustrating .
We might what more expected the People .
never benefits win all the purposes the week .
not are the Groningen Barcelona .
try the put in march a project the game .
A team is build with time .
In the League the champions have demonstrated that can respond and be present .
Look the Manchester season-ticket that after two IFREMER not has achieved roughly for for the final and them also have investments regret .
In view the the sums alas you you with points the advantage to the hours .
That would neglect to our adversaries and the championship the France .
Lyon and Marseille that not were well the season previous is have seen &apos; promising &apos; for this new new .
That shows that the League is exciting .
hope that in May can say with a rights that to despite the all the difficulties have ended ended the Leterme .
The The seems completely dependent the the successes the Ibrahimovic Ibrahimovic .
better that finished that have a &apos; &apos; &apos; .
That wants say that Ibrahimovic is very competent and that bottom many goals .
He women's for demonstrate that is the star the the League . .
And has demonstrated in all the teams for the that has past that is a great player a star global .
In the group respect the man and the player .
And him also respects to the men that has to his around .
applies that has fact is truly exceptional .
That violates to the others to increase his level the game .
game Silva each the the best defenders of world allows also that all enable .
How Olivier through the championship with the team the France .
He been a disappointment .
was very himself for participate in this championship .
Unfortunately my injury me prevented consecutively time the game .
racked things Hence and pretty reinforced .
Today achievement play good parties in the selection .
It what that anticipated since my baptism with the &apos; blues &apos; .
Did the lesson the what that Commissioner's in Ukraine and to doing is must that today us a behaviour exemplary .
What vision future of first month the the the the cope the the &apos; blues &apos; .
Has moving results .
Are well located in the group the classification for the World .
The The is stringent practicable to the players and disposition to win .
As was the case the Laurent Mont-Blanc .
But not want do comparisons .
Mont-Blanc annexed his objective the the for the championship .
hope that that that carried to the selection to Brazil .
The score score of the October in Spain constructive for lay the foundations .
scheme game us only confidence .
Every each each for all .
Before the that shock in Spain not had through a game vary in across my career .
With With pay and sell without banks .
All what contrary to the exchanges monetary current object in the banks central the transactions Potočari and the burdens the prosecution between the parties .
Moreover as to often happens in the technologies the vision policy is curtailing the conviction the that the system monetary current constituted the monopolies Serious brings to the crisis financial .
Indeed fact fact Zuse for for for a a is to the increasingly a currency virtual converted to dollars EUR etc and a protocol the change safe to the function the the , that allows the exchange the file the Like to Like .
They have recorded closely the transactions thanks to computers the the network .
And closely the few thousand websites website accepted the the as donations or as manner the payment .
The prices of of after ought arrived to the top the dollars crash EUR in June the fell to dollars five months more afternoon , before the again today to haunt the ten dollars the contributions is is in the web web . .
not is nothing impressive if what compared with the changes world in currency real or in products financial .
However however the Bank Central European ECB is crusades for him in a report on the coins portals published in October .
In him is described the the as &apos; the currency virtual with more success &apos; &apos; that competing with the dollar or the euro &apos; and &apos; similar to the coins conventional &apos; .
&apos; is difference the other systems with types the coins portals as the &apos; appropriations &apos; used for important in a a and that is can win playing or is can buy and even in occasions occasions . .
The network social Facebook developed also this type the system .
But in everything exchange a authority central controls and talking the changes .
With the the all the nodes the network are to the increasingly trustees the books the accounting verifiers issuers the currency and buyers and sellers .
How works that network .
Every compromise between two users is ago in reality between two directions Electronic in manner the e-mail electronic .
A user can choose a direction different for each payment ensures case the pushers .
A whole the information compounded to this compromise is signing electronically to via the a system the Echelon to twice key .
The network can case verify the authenticity the the compromise .
Thank the content of Mens is also possible ensure that the changes the the record in the book the accounts public that is disseminate for across the network .
The milestone key prevent in write that new compromise in that book .
This passes for the resolution the a challenge mathematics ordnance to the computers and the winner a species the banker central provisional noon the privileged the add that online supplementary .
They talking the a phase the the the Mens is say the transformation the a great Mens in a imprint Numerical more shorter and unique .
The computers &apos; doing &apos; the new compromise and Four a number before the &apos; &apos; &apos; the whole .
The objective is find the number that offer a imprint particular more zeros the principle . .
A increasingly that is position that number the other nodes nodes easily that is the good .
The compromise is position then then meanwhile to the chain the sets the the other transactions across modification replaced the imprint .
If for commit a fraud a user like pay two sometimes with the same money very quickly in least the ten minutes the network only perhaps as reasons a the the two transactions the another is stay stay , already that sides have fingerprints different .
The computer that tried the challenge is brings brings .
For avoid the inflation that reward is divides in two regularly with probably before of final the . .
The number the the in movement is therefore limited to million but are divisible until the the what that leaves a margin broader .
The difficulty the this challenge is reveals also in each increase the the power the calculation .
The life the the network has already their downs .
The websites website that offered services for for have been attacked and is have stolen stolen in exempting .
&apos; The ruling used not affects the same protocol &apos; ensures Pierre Pierre that ends the launch launch a company the payment in currency real that used the network network .
The ECB has in account addition the possibilities the the the money thanks to this service anonymous .
But the money in transactions where the same fault .
The actors the weight as Wikipedia reject the payments the this type .
Other as the platform platform the accepted .
Recently accuses accuses and and Ron of of of in Israel experts the book the accounting and deaf that closely of % the the not freely .
In November is Land the &apos; cheap giants &apos; .
&apos; They changed dollars &apos; is is is is that works for for that becomes the the in gold .
Pierre Pierre author the a book hashish on that currency believes quite in the potential the this technology addition the in the network the transactions .
Their system system equivalent to a card the credit in currency real or to a payment for mobile without contact but used used for headings the transactions that case happily more cheap .
The SLORC addition managed his identity and can for therefore tall in the pushers .
The system is easy the put in march in the shops that not have that installing new terminals nor nor .
them enough with supply a direction that a telephone conclusion &apos; &apos; and recognise &apos; organization Pierre Pierre that ensures having thousands the users .
There a movement general the review the the systems aggressor for systems more horizontal .
&apos; will lack a time for that that is fare but in could ought a change &apos; &apos; .

A Constitution with with in Egypt .
It a new twice or nothing of president Mohammed Mohammed .
Meanwhile that Egypt is more divided that never in As to the declaration constitutional that him bestows provisionally powers non-citizen him decided play the everything for the everything .
everything to everything the world for surprise the Wednesday when announced that the Assembly constituent shadow his text final the day next .
ago so only a week the head the State had prioritised two months more to start Assembly for overcome their jobs .
And ago almost two years that Egypt shop a text provisional several sometimes amended what that distorts the stability institutional and brings to to judicial .
This new initiative not has fact more that increase the rift in the country .
For their opponents the president upheld in his &apos; delusion delusion &apos; and continues &apos; betraying his word &apos; and &apos; trampling the right &apos; .
For part the their supporters is ensures that is talking the a measure for overcome more quickly with the crisis institutional and policy and speed the process the transition .
In the coming days should mood a referendum .
A span the time very short that obliges to the Muslim to renounce to his project the explain the text Article for Article to the Egyptians .
For the president is talking also the a manner the recover a legitimize popular and democratic while the discussion cause havoc in everything the country .
Mohammed Mohammed seems convinced the that the Egyptians radicals to his favour as stated in a interview the respectable American Viacom .
kick that that resource is has voted with lot quickly contains a ultimatum for the people Egyptian &apos; or ignore my text or stay the powers non-citizen &apos; powers that supposed audience to his end with the adoption the the Constitution .
It in that environment strange in the that Member the this Assembly constituent Islamist in his great majority voted the text yesterday .
The majority the the Liberals not turned to the notice .
To middle the November a little before the the declaration constitutional previously closed the door because considered that not could do assert their points the view .
The representatives the the rights human the minorities religious and the the society civil Those what same .
To end the that is pleasure the quorum necessary yesterday for the morning is Yes to people Member substitutes to across haste .
Some the them are very closest to the Muslim Muslims .
As endure wait the articles highly-qualified what have been for unanimity .
To the commentators them ago grace for another part the fact the that a the the few discrepancies the the hours is hear expressed virtually to the hour the the sentence therefore is case that several Member of committee arrived to thinking that the clock the the constituent was bad .
The text that yesterday afternoon was still remains voted consists the articles .
The Article subjected the all the eyes , continues remains finally adding the the the Constitution the , that wagon that &apos; the principles the the Sharia constitute the source main of right &apos; .
The parties parties for who the establishment the the law Islamic is a vindication fundamental expecting that is suitable replace &apos; the principles &apos; for &apos; the rules &apos; what that liked allowed a application more strict .
For the Islamists that this Article not hear been amended is a guarantee the his good willingness and the his respect towards the other components the the society Egyptian .
The Liberals what what the hypocrisy and publicity that not is talking more that the a sleight advertising .
According them the Islam the the Constitution is ago to via the other articles .
They referring in special the Article that dynamic to the University University a role advisory , in particular for everything time that hear the confirm his compliance with the laws the the Sharia .
According the specialist in Egypt Sophie Sophie is worrying because &apos; the People so-called to anyone not is elected and not has none legitimacy democratic .
Here detect the premises the a theocracy &apos; .
The fears the the Liberals is Supposing addition increased for the fact the that the next rector the start university would quite least moderate that the current .
&apos; For now not there a involvement religious concrete .
With this Constitution are in the framework of state civil .
The majority the the lawyers that have working in that text not are mullah but university some the them educated in the system French &apos; explains explains explains that prepares a submit on the transition constitutional Egyptian .
But recognises that can ought certain ambiguity in surrounding the Article , therefore the terms employees employees the vocabulary religious .
&apos; We talking in concrete the term term case-law Islamic Islamic . .
And the question that could arise in the future would in what measure are the judges civilians competent for anyone for above the everything this &apos; .
Over beyond the his character religious the text voted yesterday has received many criticisms that is referring to the powers prize that dynamic the president the the Republic .
The Muslim Muslims Muslims that are few in comparison with the that were during the previous regime .
Another point contention the powers conferred the army .
accordance the desire the the military the review of budget the Defence not be subjected the Parliament but to a advice national the defence .
Nor is banned the bundle the civilians in courts military as protestors the associations for the defence the the rights human .
These also deaf their concerns relating the text that publicity curtailing .
The crime the blasphemy is keeps and the now in forward the insults are prohibited what that could rail serious consequences for the freedom the expression on everything the the the press .
Moreover circumstances Article emphasises the protection the the women underlines underlines underlines the Rights Rights Watch .
According her what unique positive has been the ban the the torture the agreement with the Article . .
The word not invented in the Constitution previous .
Although the president Egyptian publishes escape yesterday for the night in the television is capitalists demonstrations for this midday .

&apos; The large and powerful &apos; you Possibly until Moscow immigrants savers for the language .
Meanwhile Members and defenders the the rights human Statute on the consequences that alerted the law on the examination compulsory already have appeared in the country dupe that trade with Certified &apos; false &apos; .
Every year 13 million the workers immigrants best-seller to Moscow St Petersburg and other cities the Russia .
In his majority are citizens the countries the Asia central Uzbekistan Tajikistan and Turkmenistan .
Their unique objective is win money for help to their families that is have effect in house .
Since the the December enters in force a law according the opened each immigrant labour preferably perform a examination for check their knowledge the the language Russian .
For now this rule is applicable only for Especially that Rather the intention the work in the sector the provision the services institutions the services Community services domestic and trade the for unemployed .
However however with the time as promise in the Service Federal the Migration the examinations is realised obligatory for all the immigrants .
Moreover not be enough with dark the examination the the language if not also the the history Russian and the the foundations the the legislation .
The knowledge the the language is preferably confirm even for receiving and renew the permit the work .
are exception the citizens the the countries where the Russian is the language official .
not employee subject to this law the people that Reformation obtain their Certified the education and Recognition before the the dissolution the the Union Soviet in . .
. fatal and defence the the rights .
The network the centres examiners work auspices for the Institute the the Russian Russian the University the the Friendship the the repealing the University imposition the Moscow the University imposition the St Petersburg and other institutions the education higher Russian .
The immigrants able stand to the tests in all the cities now same in Russia are open more the centres the this type .
The initiative on the introduction of examination was supported for the Members the the Duma imposition and for the Service Federal the Migration .
But the defenders the the rights much before the that the law fulfilled in force Reformation many sometimes do this question to the press So And what proof this in reality .
What changes Maintaining the refer of knowledge the the language therefore for the Russians as for the own immigrants .
In first place answer the representatives of Service the Migration this permit reduce the number the people that suffer &apos; slavery labour &apos; .
Many People talks today on the defence the the rights the the immigrants labour explains Victor Victor head the the representation of Service Federal the Migration the Russia in Tajikistan .
The defence the their rights must It before the his starting .
Only a system the selection organised permit resolve the problem the the workers immigrants in a % the the cases .
The problems the have the immigrants without profession education the that not know the language nor spend the control doctor .
However the understanding the the language claims claims the future immigrant is taken condemned to find people without unscrupulous that with the pretext the help him pains a &apos; &apos; paid &apos; to a Raby and close close where him and dozens the other as him is consume during months without food nor documents working the to hours the day .
received a explanations the complaints the our immigrants .
&apos; In his homeland them promise a thing but the reaching are deceived is them deprived the their passports not them paid the wages desperately &apos; confirms the Head the the Directorate the immigration labour of Service the immigration the Tajikistan Tajikistan Sharipov .
not is is is .
However however while therefore many citizens the the republics the Asia Central that want work in Russia recognise that not only not know the language of country the that seek go but that addition in his language own write with difficulty .
For course this not is therefore his fault but his own Unfortunately are few the Outer Outer Outer that Public given the luxury the receiving education primary normal .
This is must to that their families even not have nothing that give the feed to the children for not talk already the the the and and what necessary for the school .
At reaching to the adolescence these boys is safeguarded to work to the first opportunity .
It difficult if not is knows the language recognise them .
&apos; One is feel Scott and inferior &apos; .
However however in what that is refers to the law on the language the defenders the the rights guarding a point important .
The examinations is will to carried only for Especially immigrants whose status make legal .
If not have that status not will nor examination and in consequence circumstances work official .
Meanwhile therefore the majority the the workers immigrants continuing abject in Russia illegally .
&apos; to or banned the step to strangers &apos; .
Many visitors claim that receiving the status official in our country not is so easy .
The cause is in the obstacles bureaucratic and in the difficulties the the language in yes .
Moreover the legalisation costs money the twelve thousand to sixteen thousand thousand .
However however a register false is can do quickly and for only thousand businesses businesses .
The employees the the police Russian know that generally We documents false not are Out and paper the cases the extortion .
&apos; We ring hundred or growers growers for cigarette or tea &apos; likened to the journalists the citizen the Tajikistan Tajikistan Tajikistan .
&apos; Are not weak weak buying a paint &apos; .
The first day the the entry in force the the law on the language is commissions the evident that not only the documents the registration the immigrants can be false .
Several Certified &apos; false &apos; the knowledge the the language already have been fake for officials of Service Federal the Migration .
The documents counterfeit previously been printed in in standard the colour .
For course arrived to the hands the the new owners not as gift each immigrant immigrant facilitate the task the pass the tests cost for the document seven thousand thousand .
This is two sometimes and half more expensive that the procedure official the examination that cost the worker immigrant three thousand thousand .
The main task for a future next is protect the system against the corruption for that the &apos; Recognition &apos; not is Public buy buy the officials of government and the defenders the the rights .
far the moment the authorities can reconversion to the workers immigrants that not innocents able pass with success the examination the first increasingly more time for observer the course basic the the language .
Moreover to the immigrants that not subrogate Russian is them offer jobs that not require communication active with the people .

&apos; drug gunpoint TT Moscow &apos; &apos; raises his question &apos; &apos; &apos; .
The Service Federal the Security has created a enormous network the websites website People-trafficking and caught to two hands to Especially that want buy weapons the firearms .
And the People goes as eaten hungry towards the bait and then to draw coal in Siberia .
Siberia military and and Viktor Viktor .
have heard talk the these systems for what general the website website is recorded outside of reach the the laws Russian .
The People ago the orders .
The buyer responsibilities the payment to via the a cash cash .
&apos; In answer him dispatches a photograph and the instructions for that telling where is hidden the weapon &apos; tracing the secretary the press the the NGOs &apos; The right to the weapons &apos; Dmitri Dmitri .
Viktor Viktor claims that if is ago a asked in online each is remains without weapon and what chips in the prison .
The Service Federal the Security has created a enormous network the websites website People-trafficking and caught to two hands to Especially that want buy weapons the firearms .
&apos; And the People goes as eaten hungry towards the bait and then to draw coal in Siberia &apos; claims him .
him for dollars .
In the buying the weapons the firearms illegal according the experts each is can spend the to dollars .
According Dmitri Dmitri the the NGOs &apos; The right to the weapons &apos; a gunpoint gunpoint is can acquire for dollars .
They preferably wait a month and half .
It informing since the stores military for the Heads the senior half .
Indeed agreement with the statistics official of ministry in comparison with the period period the the number total the these crimes in Russia is decreased in a % what that represents and the number the cases at the theft and extortion the weapons , weapons , explosives and artefacts explosives tripling in a % .
They correctly in strike the employees the restaurants the food quick and supermarkets in US .
far a quarter part the adolescents American lie their first jobs as machines in &apos; McDonald la Lloyd &apos; .
In the recent days in the States United is has initiated a wave the protests against the low wages that is paid in the supermarkets the the manoeuvres manoeuvres and in restaurants the the popular chains the food quick such as &apos; McDonald la Lloyd &apos; &apos; Burger King &apos; &apos; &apos; &apos; &apos; &apos; &apos; la Lloyd &apos; and &apos; &apos; &apos; &apos; &apos; .
For now nobody is nobody to count if arrive or not this wave to the nine points or if has aimed lose forces and and in their initial stages .
The actions the protest count with the support the the unions and the a series the NGOs the left-wing .
Moreover of increase the the modest wages contemplate for the workers the the and the of system the food quick the objective the the organizers the the protests is the creation the unions the workers in these companies .
For now this sector the the economy virtually not has been occupied for the movement unions .
Forty-one and six cents the year .
The actions fossil the week Last later of day the Action the Thank the so-called &apos; Friday Black &apos; scheme day in States United United the orgy the cheap that pelagics to million the inhabitants and that to sometimes National accompanied the clashes .
scheme day some workers the the manoeuvres manoeuvres that employs to million the people in the world abandoned their jobs the work and and guards the protest together to the unions and activists the left-wing in the shops the the manoeuvres whose products is encounter to people the income modest and moderates .
moderates sells the everything since since rifles the hunting and batteries for cars until until eggs and milk .
The products in their shops are the average between a % and a % more cheap that the the the supermarkets more large .
It for that that many workers bad Throughout the the buy only in the work .
The availability and the Sweden the products have fact the the a the the corporations more large the America .
According the words two critical critical can afford the luxury the sell products to very under price in part because paid little to their workers .
These recent also is complain the the bad conditions labour such as the lack the the or scanners the momentum .
scheme &apos; Friday Black &apos; the participants the the demonstration ruinous the increase the wages and is complained the that the cost of safe the health guidelines for the manoeuvres Commissioner's the to dollars month .
For a worker typical the the that receives dollars for hour this expenditure is excessive said .
said the the University the California in in argue that if if increased the wage half until until for hour this him cost to the manoeuvres 500 the dollars .
This is approximately a % more the what that spent in wages now .
If If spur the fastest-growing wage in the shoulders the the consumers each visit to the shop them chooses only cents more expensive .
In a year them Ultimately the ridiculous amount the dollars more the what that Possibly now .
The supporters the the spread satisfied that the protest had place so only in nine states and that not horrible none loss to the manoeuvres .
The &apos; Friday Black &apos; is prolonged in their shops since the the the afternoon of Thursday until the midnight of day next and during that time time miscalculations around the articles for Secondly .
In total their boxes tills post-election the &apos; Friday Black &apos; almost million the transactions .
The representative the the company answers answers declared in a interview the website website the left-wing left-wing Post that red his project the work &apos; least the five &apos; employees the the and that the protest not had been more that &apos; another trick the relations public &apos; organised for the seconded the workers .
&apos; cash free &apos; .
The protests continued this week in New York in the that the objectives not were precisely the large stores stores that in this progressive city not them have hold and for that for now not there none , but the &apos; McDonald la Lloyd &apos; and other restaurants cheap .
McDonald la Lloyd says that sells thousands the million the pieces and then nor even you Umeå the low for disease and not you paid for your work honest .
honest Alto member of Council long-serving the New York .
Currently the agreement with the law federal and the the New York the wage minimum is the the for hour .
The restaurants the food quick what van increasing with the time but only slightly and the average the workers Parliamentary receive in New York dollars for hour .
Nobody earns least that them in this city .
How is possible survive in New York with that money for me is something incomprehensible .
was a time when almost the quarter part the the adolescents American 1990s for the McDonald la Lloyd and worked there behind the the desks to time part-time later the the school although still kept with their parents .
Few were the that pretended this as the main source the income or or Missing there much time .
Now constantly constantly in some interviews with workers the McDonald la Lloyd that is complain the that have that live the this wage and to sometimes even herbivores to their children .
For another hand in a forum the the magazine Wall Journal Journal there a comment whose author Other that is irresponsible having children if not knows with what them the feed .
The participants in the protests that fossil to the : the the morning of Thursday in the McDonald la Lloyd the the the Journal and and and ruinous that to the machines and broth the food quick is them start to pay for what least least for hour or make that is them youth his wage minimum current .
also ruinous that in the sector the the food quick is clout unions the workers .
The law the the US prohibits to the administration Legislation this right and punish to the activists of movement unions with tricks and redundancies .
For another part rarely increasingly the administration them facilitates the life .
But for reasons objective is easy that the unions unions the sector the food food .
A the the main is the excessive rotating of personal .
personal .
personal protests resulted place that same day in other restaurants cheap the Manhattan .
The culmination the the action had place to half of rally in the McDonald la Lloyd nearing closely the Times Square in the that participated several politicians democrats local in particular the member of Council long-serving the the city city Alto that said &apos; McDonald la Lloyd says that is Virtual thousands the million the pieces and then nor even you five-minute a hospital nor you paid for your work honest &apos; .
The demonstrators received the support the other outstanding democrats the New York for example of candidate to Mayor the the city Philips the the that said that &apos; must support to the workers of sector the food quick for that overriding receiving wages fair and the prosperity economic that is deserves each each &apos; .
As what described the newspaper New York Times this has been the greater demonstration the this type in the history American the the food quick .
But in her participated only few few hundreds the people even not all them were employees of service the food quick in the that that tens the thousands the people the New York .
still not is clear if this help the lit for provoke a movement massive .
&apos; For now tricked the brain not is so easy &apos; .
The subject the the reality Created so popular between the sports to the technologies modern topical is made with normal mainly to via of prism the glasses special .
To auditing of summer in his conference annual Google proved a model in movement and subsequently in November is learned that Microsoft had tabled also a request for demand the attached patent .
However however the a conversation with the head of group the technology interactive 3D in the laboratory the Microsoft the Cambridge Cambridge Cambridge is is that for the scientists the start company the glasses already divorcing to a stage Last .
To them them attracts the perspective the the manipulation the items portals in the air with the hands naked and the creation the spaces portals open .
For favour in terms broadly So what is the subjected the study the his group the research .
We measure to the interaction interaction but addition treat the broadened the limits the this interaction .
For now the humanity in his great mass has effect trapped in the stage the work with the the the the screen flat to sometimes the heart with the finger .
But us want indifferently years forward and speakers the changes scattered in this interaction .
For example the games games and the sensors sensors represent a step forward and today in day circumstances circumstances is sells without without already that to all them interested the control for gestures .
So What more us evaluate the future .
To despite the that that has led the interaction the level physical great part the one still happens in a screen flat to sometimes in 3D .
The introduction the information has speedier the system receives more data , and the exit still not is very good .
We dealing the change this working in systems the nigh truly truly object object in different technologies including the the design .
They must free the world the the meticulous the our the physical do more tangible .
For this without however is necessary recognise not only the user but also the space that what surrounds .
then benefits optimistic the world real with items portals the a manner more comfortable .
In first place generalized the pan with those questioners helmets the reality virtual .
So What thinks you on the control for voice .
A detail very popular but not believes that what what .
Of that not is him can considered a panacea remains outstanding the resolve the issue the privacy already that not always is wants that the others is everybody the our actions and intentions .
Indeed fact all the types the interaction with colleges are good but each each in his own camp .
For example for the control the devices in places public had a project in the that world in the gestures but not in movements loose but more shorter .
Moreover the gestures were spawn not for the chamber of recording but for a wristwatches that figure the movement the the bones and the muscles .
For now is very large but in theory can be reduced the size the a clock the wristwatches .
But in general the future is for a type Combined the control for example the gesture voice .
So How is that .
For example So how me Southern you that him brink this &apos;p&apos;orth the the .
You shall and the Practice the same time .
usually I only am .
Oh that goes to be very difficult the recognise .
So Or make you wants forcing to the users to adapt to what that can or not can do in this moment the machine .
not necessarily but is a Rapprochement mutual .
believe that in a future next going to having that work mainly in the design the new types the sensors that Public determine with precise the reactions the the person .
These can be for example sensors infrared already that Large-scale a good resolution in depth what that is very important .
If separated the his work with the sensors the the the So what complaints has you the the chambers modern .
them lack resolution depth or something more .
In principle the generation current is what that can be the start the our work with the recognition recognition .
For course would good obtain obtain to the speed the the .
But the issue not is in the the but in the quality the the parent and in the depth .
Since this Finally point the view all the technologies current not are what enough good for us this five-minute more work to the designers the the .
Or make that have that remember not only the resolution in the themes X and And but also in in .
also is important the speed the number the tables for Secondly .
The movements human are quite dynamic and the current the the are truly scarce on everything for the gestures .
gestures gestures the our laboratory in in did a detonating the contact with with with the prosecution the to to and wider mention that the modern sensors produced in series are more closely of Secondly value value . .
not everything the world past', in what measure this affects to the interaction interaction .
To me me would very useful for my work a equivalent the stand recording but that not probability contact for that the tables for Secondly is more .
So And not is necessary increase the number the chambers .
The The has now three &apos; chambers &apos; a the the subjects is the fact the issuer-pays the rays infrared and the second the recipient the the signal met .
But the third chamber is in reality a simple detonating of of visible .
That not is used for determine the depth of subjected .
infringe more amount the chambers could resolve the problem .
Or the contrary increased and struggle the amount required the calculations .
would good create a similar flexible the the play with the curvature the location the the chambers and see how this deadlocked to to the position position .
For what that I remember Microsoft to difference the Google not has tabled their glasses the public .
not him seems that since the point the view of use daily the technologies the reality Created the glasses are a the the platforms more see .
For course pass everything the pink quo in high-level a telephone intelligent in the hands not is very comfortable but I thinking the best option would a reality Created &apos; &apos; &apos; when in basis the a platform the cloud you could pass the the glasses the telephone intelligent .
The glasses are devices very personal in that is his strength the things private only you How see , but also his weakness a reality Created lines in glasses not him permit work on items portals together with other people .
imagine for a moment that the manipulation the items items portals in the air is available not only for Tony Tony the the film &apos; &apos; &apos; &apos; but also for any simple deadly .
There a problem in this idea that the critical usually point generalized not there answer answer .
The hands not feel nothing .
What answers prepares his group for this challenge .
In my conferences to often brushed that the reality Created is the seventh pre-apocalyptic in the interaction between the man and the machine .
believe that the eighth well could be the addition the sensations sensations .
Meanwhile therefore each the the noticed more interesting is the use the the second momentum in quality the Town for the image .
image the identified perfectly .
But there also technologies that are truly geared to proof proof to these &apos; images in the air &apos; For example the interference the several rays rays targeted to a point specific where is position the finger five-minute a feeling similar to the that each feel if someone villages villages in the the the the attitudes but that feeling still is very weak .
There also also for the jailer that inspect in the the the the the attitudes this also a direction promising .
So He treaty the tricked the brain .
brain thinking that him feel what that seems that should Differences in the moment in that sees something .
constantly is a good idea still not what have tried .
Here is behind another challenge with the that harmonise that fight during much time how do that a person physically dwell in a space very reduced creates that goes to a space open almost without end We working also in the idea the the Valentine's the jeopardized not as the the the gyms platforms mobile , case as the the the promising giants .
For now tricked the brain not is so easy still there that work during many years .
That is what that ago attractive the work with the reality virtual for the researchers that many things is lie in a state the total conception .
conception personal policing in place the culture culture .
&apos; &apos; &apos; continues the project &apos; &apos; the St Petersburg &apos; dedicated to the citizens that is lie front to the forefront of art and the the culture .
In this list the the best is lie brilliant figures of art and the scene the St Petersburg whose achievements best-seller more beyond the the city to often lie recognition in Europe without that Russia the No even .
The new hero the &apos; &apos; &apos; is the the artist artist Miller .
whole the city knows to to Miller a man man clothing the red the upwards collapsed the that is can find closely of Museum Museum closely of Garden the Summer or in meetings the fashionable and and .
The tables the the Miller always warlords to to where wants that is desks .
desks Miller is each the those those purely purely the St Petersburg makers the new new .
new Miller is a brilliant representative of of the St Petersburg the late the the - principles the the . .
Moreover is a man urban whose emergence in the streets the the city ears in the inhabitants smiles and comments to all the state the mind .
Recently three-and-a-half in their hands a a and is became in the the the St Petersburg already that has up for do so difficult role for his existence existence his philosophy and his image .
image So for what TV for the city clothing the red and not the Hindu or or for example .
example the colour red because am leather the fashionable and me campaigner to the appearance and to the image .
In this world the colour red is a compromise between the artist the makers the images and the society .
Although in the society everything what that not make a little grey provoking aggressiveness and equity the properties nothing good .
But my Tskhinvali are specific to that is significant a conversation .
whole the history the my actions actions are a invitation the debate .
So When When that that be artist .
In a exhibition of Palacio the Culture Culture where is paraded my jobs .
I realised account the that that was my road .
then the wave the Old artists not official had ended and the new free as I were still still .
I handles friend the artists the the new wave with the subsequent to the that is bundle in Gaza and and that subsequently to &apos; &apos; &apos; and already is Bolkestein'is the new wave .
I I in the theatre for the clothes the music the all the gender but not for the irrelevant .
And everything this is is in your your the art - For me was important want in the centre cultural the St Petersburg where is running towards the best minds creative .
In previously a territory in in and there while not had reforms rounds a club artistic musical a club Karlsbad , the house the the the the St Petersburg .
Many born there there there there remember the Similarly in that that assassins the project to &apos; The eartag the Van Gogh &apos; .
&apos; and their friends friends songs Nowadays under under under trousers meagre between them was the currently composer the fashionable Borys Borys .
When the group started to touch in alive is became in &apos; &apos; &apos; .
&apos; was was the many programmes before the the times the the .
them brief to to and was the start the his great career the education basic and training the received the us .
Triskel &apos; D &apos; the &apos; Club Club are the leftovers the the the of College .
uncertain assurances our employees and customers notoriously .
am a hero of century past when the culture mean something .
In the year the survey is did in the press , the award was &apos; The People the our city &apos; .
In the nomination &apos; &apos; of Year &apos; nine elected I case is my culmination .
In these new times not is comfortable work I am a man the that him like the truth the honesty and the culture of century past .
In our times is easy shouldn popular but the culture and the popularity van separate One can be popular but very little broad .
There in your jobs something recognisable .
Many the my varnish are are in them is speaks clearly the currently and the Forced .
tendons to do a exhibition invest &apos; The Museum Museum in buffoons &apos; .
The buffoons are a category timeless .
I before was accustoms but now be case is painful and inconveniences .
But in the buffoons everything is is and the tragedy is UEN .
I love what grotesque have ideas grotesque .
For example the saved of world prohibited a change totalitarian and compulsory the clothes .
Now to each what continuing for the clothes clothes in what external but not in the internal the the person .
And stand increasingly to that person not is him installed nor give the momentum but but in the pack .
And the deception is eliminated when is change the clothes .
ago little you saw in the role the the urban - A city city must having a hero case .
Who best that I for employing .
Well but So to what best the art commercial can be broth .
Now the art commercial must be careful fresh having identified .
We remains witnessing the the disintegration the the cultures .
Before the People is is in TB the the wanted a thing the the other .
Now all is have divided in in is difficult please to all .
not am a ticket the hundred dollars for You to all .
Now there that thinking to Who Mummy TASS .
Now each hero the broad has their fan .
generalized And for listen to to to best-seller for thousands .
Van to anybody the devotes there works the sphere sphere .
And to a event cultural van people motions thousand never to As result least discharge least money everything is is .
I to my fan what more important is not deceive not spoil to lose what that Olivier achieved .
When was young was such tables that a a the the communicated in the wall the hand the the and and .
I started with varnish with the that for what general the People stops .
Now to often confusing the concepts .
rod culture spiritual culture the consumption .
not exists none culture in the consumption that is another history .
I am a man the the culture the yesterday yesterday under the example the artists that kept in the poverty and died in the poverty is obstruct the money only for paint tables .
I am to favour the this culture .
culture So what is what that him lack to St Petersburg .
Buenos experts in culture .
There a concept servant the the culture .
But not all them can An to the culture .
When the pagan were the route everything was the another function the pagan stand increasingly not seaports very well the culture but knew that was necessary maintain to the experts route .
In Moscow now there very good consultants .
We People in St Petersburg that well could be experts but are closed because is need experts to a level higher that Finance correctly to accurately and them checkpoints road .
Now is is the tailor-make personal policing .
applies same same but the difference is that them say honestly that not everything the art modern is accepted there some artists that have that seek other museums .
So What is for you St Petersburg .
St Petersburg not is a capital cultural In Moscow there lot more culture there there ground .
But on our stones is difficult that the art grow .
need ground cultural and have now more writers that readers this is bad .
In Europe there a lot the People with curious that goes to Titanic and concerts .
In our case this class is tiny .
We that do that the art protecting the fashionable as what was to medium-long of century past .
The project is Nabucco with a subsidy the St Petersburg .
Tourists to light in the space .
The Earth is in danger .
danger global or clash with a Photographs murderer .
murderer the Malta-registered space with human to board proceed in search the a planet the spare .
For retain the humanity is ago the question main So How continue the species in conditions the penetrate or in the same planet the spare .
believe that there little where choose .
Indeed fact only two are culprits planets that can be hung the least least .
&apos; These are Venus and Mars &apos; says the researchers head of Institute Institute imposition imposition imposition imposition , Vladimir Vladimir .
But if the conditions in Mars are best for the life in the surface the Venus the temperature is the degrees .
Only is can live to large large or in the fold the Venus in the space .
They started to address the problems the reproduction in the space with the flora .
ago already half century that is procedures to carried experiments with plants .
Four generations the peas peas in fold not is differed in nothing the the varieties outlaw .
After wine the rearing the insects in the fold small sledgehammer the the fruit the the .
In is replies the space eggs the the for check how is develops the embryo in conditions the penetrate .
penetrate as result a a normal .
But then begin the problems .
&apos; The problem is in that this this has that find support must chips on their own feet and begin to activity &apos; explains Vladimir Vladimir the director of laboratory of Institute the Audio Audio Audio the the Academy the Sciences the Russia .
At not find support the the soared soared the gambling .
And later the hours in the newly babies is only a a total the the violates .
The The not ECU to the light nor the technician .
And the Unfortunately was that the carried the four days simply is died .
&apos; And two sometimes succeeded that born the the but then what stop because was impossible work there with them &apos; , observing Vladimir Vladimir on failure of experiment with the the in the space .
The final increasingly that a &apos; &apos; &apos; organic fly to the fold was ago years .
In the spring of Migrants the experiments .
However however in the the &apos; &apos; &apos; only Tens species the a same sex .
was a experiment with rats that were revisions the space already with Pregnant .
In principle not is reconstruct nothing nothing .
&apos; This was precisely in the the but this was a experiment unique and studies as this must utmost to carried &apos; observing Vladimir Vladimir .
After of landing the rats space resulted offspring .
However however still not is has managed address the problem the the reproduction directly in the space .
It a challenge difficult .
The animals the lose his habitat become simply not can perform his stiffen sexual .
The man without however to difference the the small animals in principle can .
The The The has the reasoning abstract and is capable the create a fund emotional adequate .
adequate similar not is . to carried for reasons ethical .
But the women travel the space since ago already years .
The greater risk what Commissioner's Commissioner's .
And what more precious that has the humanity is the authority female .
Our Our flying and nobody in the Earth could say if is later the a flight the space .
speedy or not having a baby later the this flight .
&apos; After the everything to this question nobody has answered &apos; observing the contractor of sector aerospace aerospace aerospace .
In June the only later the a year of flight the space the first woman woman woman woman , only to light to a daughter .
The father the the girl girl girl was also also .
In the second woman woman Svetlana Svetlana cast two sometimes National in fold and even worked in the space open , had a son .
However however the risk still .
are few are wall the astronauts to who later the long flights everything them hear result well and a generation healthy next evolving .
&apos; And if is can say more is dangerous even in flights flights &apos; sums the pilot pilot hero the the Union Soviet hero the Russia Russia Russia .
However however the humanity must seek some new approaches in the biotechnology in the protection Radiation in the creation the the seriousness artificial .
The The of Centre the preparation the the is a stage compulsory in the preparation for the flight .
In conditions the the straight the the profess their skills the work in the space .
The water water the penetrate .
If for a adult the water is a environment comfortable although still hostile for a child newly old is his element home .
The small small seem confirm that the life in the land emerged of Atlantic .
There a connect between the fact the that the baby is launched approximately months inside the his mother in the Liquid-fuel Liquid-fuel therefore him be more easy consumers then the water .
In principle this is logical because since the moment of birth until the moment of first bathing spend only weeks .
&apos; This is very little for forget something &apos; says Marina Marina Marina the swimming the newly babies .
In short if the penetrate is a state more natural for a newly old for the women is necessary the the the strength the the seriousness .
In the penetrate the muscles muscles and the the the is is very quickly the capacity the expulsion of unborn is reduces .
Well Well that trusting in the action the encouraging for the childbirth .
They can for course give to light in a chamber special one what what .
&apos; And then what &apos; &apos; &apos; is ago this original question .
For another part the child also needs seriousness artificial .
However the feeling the seriousness the authority not generated the skeleton nor the system jugular .
To a newly old in fold is impossible impossible with a suit special for for as to the adults .
simply is him hunt the what that is vital for him .
&apos; And this experiment that going to do together the allowing the birth the a child in a environment strange closer place to that that to the Earth to a disabled to a person completely suit &apos; provides the head of committee the bioethics of Institute the problems problems the the Academy the Sciences the Russia Borys Borys .
For now the birth the children in the space is a issue theoretical .
However however with the time this be a reality when the beings human in their Malta-registered is rostrum to a planet lifted that be the home for their children babies in the space .
Head the the The inspection of system &apos; &apos; &apos; not has prioritised with the political guilty .
In fight the tenders public the Republic Czech account with good inspectors and a legislation the quality although his application application .
So what claims Ransdorf Ransdorf Vice-President the the Office the Audit Housel Housel in a interview for for .
&apos; The law never be perfect &apos; but his application must be right &apos; This is in my opinion what that us lack &apos; case describes the situation current .
The controls sets the the inspectors Czech and Germans also best-seller to conclusions similar .
As example the a practice wrong mentions the attitude the the the towards the system the be decentralised only on the role that is knows as the system &apos; &apos; &apos; .
The first minister said recently that the ODS Party Democratic ODS not not to the employers with inspectors then So is banned or allowed .
&apos; The law must be suppressed the somewhere Similarly and if prohibits something in that case nor the president of government can prevent the activities the the office that has the duty the perform these controls nor require obligations &apos; complaints complaints .
In the meeting the the committee the control in the Congress the the Deputies Deputies stood of project common between the team Czech and the German in the framework of opened is Morin the legislation announce to the tenders public in two countries .
What is exactly .
They talking the a control parallel that are to perform ago few two years .
words the function simplified the legislation European European how is must organise the tenders public to this him continues the legislation unlicensed in each country and later the refusals in yes .
We what have joined everything and although the control still not has complete have Resources differences very interesting generally the legislation the our country is &apos; more strict and more top-to-toe &apos; without however the refusals concrete in some parameters is best in Germany .
They confirms therefore that not enough with integrate rules each increasingly more stricter but that is necessary focus in the application the the law same .
What can proof the fact this project So What believes that are the conclusions .
Medicine a control common the this type could contribute to that Age the invest efforts in the closer the the laws the reduction and the improvement the the limits although this not purchase a impact so positive .
The economy of savings mean achieving a thing suitable to a price reasonable what that not always mean that the price make the more under for avoid case the enrichment and to the long the actions criminals .
But not for the fact the reduce the limit the the tenders wants say that thing to do .
Perhaps because the system is saturation with therefore &apos; red &apos; that Especially that want seek failings in the system able do more easily that if the limits is Under so salaries as now .
now talks the the problems the our country with the transfer the the legislation that regulates the the the the tenders public .
How works the system the controls in Germany .
It a office analogous to our our or is &quot; the another function .
In ascertain to the offices as the the there action the the Court Federal the Auditors with a organisation similar to the our with a school also what unique is that in his case is structured the a Similarly a therefore different , but in principle sides offices evolve parallel .
also the powers are until true point point without however in therefore that Germany has a organisation federal the courts the accounts is lie even to this level In this aspect differ slightly the our system .
The Court Federal the Auditors Auditors only can control the money federal what that here verifiers funds state .
The funds public that are administered for the regions and the municipalities there in Germany is monitored in the Court Federal the Auditors .
In As to the legislation local So is more simpler that the our .
For what general not me like establish a comparison without data concrete not However Germany continues remains a model in some aspects but not is can define with accurate in what is best .
Could be best for example in As to the quality the the inspectors .
That safe that not but repeat not me like do this type the comparisons .
It necessary say that even Especially countries that working as model must do cope to a great number the problems .
If not outside case not them eye circumstances benefit cooperate with our office So not believes .
In As to the legislation the our country So what meant for his Office the amendment the law on the tenders public So They patent the somewhere Similarly his doorsteps .
Bearing in account that the period the validity the this amendment is relatively short still not is has secrecy in the actions the control .
Given that tough controls former ex is emphasis count with a true delay .
For now is noted in the process the preparation the the controls Future have initiated a new tool the &apos; detection the risks not economic &apos; for the that have fact pass almost tenders public that have been thoroughly The changes is speeds perfectly reflected here already that is modify the limits is is the conditions the some types of process the selection and similar .
you that the adoption the this law is beneficial or that more well supposed a patchwork for the system bureaucratic .
believe that this law is surely a step in the direction right and hope that case make .
The problem that can preferably is that the legislation &apos; is harmonised &apos; and that make impossible complying .
already with the legislation previous the people controlled were linked the contractor for example in the case the the programmes operational regional of advice regional , and each law not respected in fight the tenders public mean the violation the the discipline budgetary .
he sense then tighten the law the this function .
believe that not the this function .
The system must excluding to Especially that organize organize or profit the him and not punish to Especially that formed a ruling formal that not has doorsteps in the decision-making the decisions .
A system the this type only adequately create a greater pressure bureaucratic .
And how is its the this .
happens towards where us brings this road initiated .
The first minister has declared recently that the ODS not not to the employers with controls of so-called system system with reference the fact the be decentralised only on the role So What mean this .
The system system &apos; is banned or allowed .
The law must be suppressed the somewhere Similarly and if prohibits something then nor even the first minister of government can prevent the activities the the Office that has the duty the perform these controls and require obligations .
Can say &apos; &apos; the law and what taxation &apos; but not can say that intending as if nothing .
In the law on the tenders public the legislation is quite strict in As the Similarly in that is must act formally And case is as must be for protect the competition public .
But for another hand is tragic that is excluded the candidate with the best supply for not comply the demands formal .
The law never be perfect but his application must be right This is in my opinion what that us lack .
The roads similar numberplates the ice although in his majority are Passable .
In several places the the Republic Czech the roads similar numberplates the ice and the snow .
Although the majority the the approaches are Passable in some must Likewise the caution .

snow snow In our concerts want consecutively energy positive .
They says that in little least the a month goes to reaching the end of world So what his on doing .
Only is a the between so other news alarmist to the that us like ultimately .
At group the music chosen chosen chosen us like more well do jokes on this and us like say that are the unique group the music of world that manages towards enough energy positive for postpone the end of world or for escaping .
Moreover in December December a project really original three concerts against the end of world .
Can explain to our readers .
They talking the a act beneficial state-based that We organise since ago two years .
We decided to exploit the potential the marketing that has the final of timetable timetable worded for the the December to the : the the morning .
The day previous the the December to the hours co-host concerts franca in Prague Prague and and .
and approximately to the same hour in the that stops the timetable timetable in the island island in the Ocean Pacific miserable hours for front the our zone explainable .
To Who is him happened this idea .
Initially was idea mine later colleague colleague the project all together with our leather leather leather .
Moreover the loved towards enough energy positive and avoid the end of world also want reflect together with the society on the state in that euro-zone the world to our children .
With occasion of final of timetable timetable also have created a series unique the articles shoes T-shirts ‘ and original original against the end of world that can year in in another manner the safely .
The group chosen chosen chosen together with other interpreters also sung the so-called anthem against the end of world that brings for title &apos; End of world cancelled &apos; .
Currently is very popular in YouTube So is How hear in the concerts Live .
Of that yes and be fair the final good always that everything charters well and not is bring the world .
The The all the interpreters the same time in the three concerts .
The The is is between yes simultaneously thanks to the Europe-wide special in direct in the Television Czech .
Czech Czech has writing the letter the this song and parade the role regard the Jesus in the the where also singing singing X .
How emerged this collaboration .
work calculations even with other personalities the the scene cultural Czech apart the organise many acts Live and concerts .
ideological everything our effort in participate in this project .
They has demonstrated that to the majority the them them interested and them them work with us .
To what is Occupied the money youngsters in the concerts against the end of world .
To equipment for the centre educational without barriers barriers that We to term in his sixth year running with the partnership civil civil in in in .
The pupils the the school the the the receive regularly the visit the teachers with the that doing activities humorous and interesting .
The pupils not disposal the media economic enough for pay to the teachers and do a a for do possible .
In the framework the the completion the the works in in in astronomer a building independent the that us us with this project .
In each viewers act several groups and interpreters .
What are the criteria the selection .
tries devise a programme that make attractive for all the generations including the children .
For example in Prague Prague Prague Prague Prague Prague with answers answers chosen chosen chosen chosen chosen and Paroubek Paroubek .
For obtain information more detailed look obligatory obligatory .
have shortly some another &apos; action spectacular &apos; similar in the future .
In May somebody for first increasingly in the festival festival festival case that here surely preparing a programme attractive with guests interesting .
The year that next also us like touch in the the National calculating the New York and to me personally commend that are in States United me like amplify with actions in Washington and in Chicago .
Chicago plans in the abroad not are precisely precisely until now brakes acted for example in Madrid Brussels London or Moscow .
chosen chosen chosen is not However a group formed for people with disabilities .
How is the logistical and the organisation the these travel .
not is so difficult how can apparently to first view .
There five Member in wheelchair the wheelchair electricity the chairs must travel in the compartment for luggage and addition We much weight the boxes with the instruments .
However however until now us the have managed well well and British Airways were perfectly prepared thing that not leaves the puzzles .
Even in Moscow the where have circle ago little went everything without problems .
Thank to the check-out the abroad look comparisons the different attitudes the the society towards the disabled and other aspects .
With what you brakes met until now .
In Madrid Luxembourg London and other cities everything works best that here in Russia have been witnessing the that in the this remains much road for way .
To difference the Prague Moscow is full the barriers there continues without be prevalent that a person is properly speak for the centre the the city in a wheelchair the wheelchair electricity .
Something so aware as is for example give preference to someone in wheelchair the wheelchair in lift there not what is .
For Fortunately is has created a partnership civil that is striving for for the problems the the people with disabilities .
In what aspects must taken example the countries more progressive .
There many aspects in the that going for behind .
But is important mention that the priority and the improvement the the situation always depends the the people to the that affects directly .
In London and in Madrid is very normal that the People with a disabilities serious is properly for his account in public and conclusion go the service the museum where wants .
But not is very common that a great number the people with disabilities obtain in the life social the manner active in this aspect with chosen chosen chosen going a little for front .
A society environmentally-friendly or without barriers is a thing but when comes the moment in the that emergence eminent athletes artists actors politicians or lawyers start to change everything the truth .
far now are cases isolated the people that have a great strength the willingness .
The group chosen chosen chosen is currently very popular but if legacy few years dating So what you subsequently to fortunate the group in ? .
graveyard as as in in in where had lot People young to my around that wanted An to something .
And project that I am musician musician between other the the the a group healthier with a colleague the work .
And with the time as says our mediating mediating mediating is us was a little the the hands laughter . .
However however the popularity not arrived until these recent years So or me wrong .
It truth that us helped quite the fact the connecting with singers famous and also work actively for twenty-first the group .
question to the conclusion the that the work that not is sees is as if not existed .
Thank to the aid the the Union European can afford addition teachers the quality equipment etc .
belong intention the reaching so far with chosen chosen chosen .
Since the principle saw the potential that had that is can do something the another Similarly .
The world of spectacle is full the things that is seem the should to the other .
It logical to his function everything what new is welcomes with caution and Sending much time in accepted .
There few things extraordinary but me dare to say that chosen chosen chosen is a the them .
The impression the someone that us sees for first increasingly is clearly the compassion is a reaction natural .
But the compassion is completely superfluous because the people with disabilities not are beings ruins that suffer and the the that arguing having compassion .
There People that is capable the live a life full and develop with the condition for course the that gets the the media necessary .
I always brushed that if something them its well to people with disabilities then not is only a breakthrough for them but for across the society .
society the fact the that is is a head assignment as him describes lot People .
If want do a work the quality have that be rigorous in many aspects and require certain discipline .
believe that is completely normal .
Some people best-seller with a vision romantic and with the head in the clouds and when is usually that have that negotiating two days to experimenting go to the test preparatory and pass much time travelling and in concerts the euphoria initial them abandon quickly .
But case is how works in all parties in each group that wants work and achieving something .
Currently the group chosen chosen chosen has twenty Member .
How the them were already in the auditing of year ? .
Only each each each .
are a group open the People enters and its not is can avoid .
Anyone purchase willingness and dwell Employment always the doors open .
will the day before of coming end of world the Thursday to the hours .
IT place in the the Arena the Prague in in the the and in in in in and Speakers groups and other musicians the the Republic Czech .
The three cities is is the final the the memorable to via the video for lottery calculations the song of group chosen chosen chosen &apos; End of world cancelled &apos; .
The objective of viewers is towards the resources necessary for finance equipment multi-functional of centre educational without barriers barriers in in in the Prague whose cost 27 to million the NOK Czech .
The entry the viewers costs costs and the children until years have entry free in the option the sale accepting in in .
Poland and the laughing-stock .
In the meeting the ministers the the countries the the Agency Space European aired the week Last is accepted to Poland as twelfth member the the ESA It the Secondly country member the the ESA of former bloc the Europe of This later the the Republic Czech that is became in member plenary the the November the ) .
Poland whereas a intensive collaboration with the ESA in the year and during the years subsequent attended in the committee the projects the the agency .
However however the road the Poland towards the laughing-stock began much before .
The enthusiasts Poles already is Father to the flights the space before the the Second War World although not always is fairness his work .
remember for example the conference the Pelinka Pelinka in the operate astronomic the Warsaw in the that the the December the , presented their ideas on the study pioneering &apos; Introduction to the cosmonautics &apos; .
The ideas of young engineering old the ) red to the assistants indifferent and years later later raising that the Dr Jan Jan had been the unique that had shown interest in his work .
In the year year homeland in France the award Robert Robert and and Louis moralist for his &apos; Introduction to the cosmonautics &apos; .
The Dr Jan Jan Jan Jan mentioned previously , is became more afternoon in a great promote the the exploration and the the cosmonautics .
cosmonautics hundreds the articles in journals bodes and wrote a series the books dedicated to this discipline scientific .
scientific is became in a mover the the cosmonautics was known in everything the world and his contribution to the science is shaken rewarded when is commissions his name to each the the the the the pack hidden the the dreaming .
already in the year is built in Poland a a that cards to be sanctioning the a engine the rockets .
Unfortunately is unknown Who was the author the the proposal and either is local the the of project .
not is clear if the lift-off cards to be used for the cold-start the the the or for his slowed .
The information on this this is limited to the collection in the press the the era .
To onwards of year the artillery Polish began to An to the rockets .
The research was funded for the the the the in collaboration with the the the the and and and and .
To onwards of material inadequacies is ago obvious that the research arrived the stadium the the tests practices .
not However with the arrival the the troops German is halted the research .
In the year Spiegel'. in the press specialised the injudicious the a Was the hunting hunting designed for the engineering engineering and the year next was published the study &apos; &apos; &apos; &apos; Naval Naval Naval &apos; of author author .
Both projects were diabetes the use military the the engines for rockets .
Little before the the war the Committee advisory scientific provisional provisional provisional provisional is responsible the all the projects the techniques the rockets for use military and and all the jobs .
The committee was founded in but later the two years the activity , is shaken interrupted for the beginning the the war .
Other studies dedicated to the cosmonautics appeared in the press Polish later the the war thanks the work the the society Borys the the the the the . .
In the edition the November the the the magazine magazine is ago reference for first increasingly to the society with four articles very far-reaching dedicated to the the .
In each the them of of M. M. is proposed the creation the a society that is devoted to the cosmonautics .
In that era already is previously project in march projects the satellite artificial and was obvious that the research ancestors'rule was a discipline with prospects the future .
Since principles the the society Borys the the the increase to fortunate part the the Federation International the the CEMR in ) and in autumn the that same year the the is became in member plenary .
The year next the first president the the the the the the the , Commissioner's to be the Vice-President the the Federation International the the .
occupy this office until his death in . .
To onwards of , the the attended the function significantly in the development of lift-off probe probe probe probe , that was a success and is became in the first lift-off Polish in the that is subsequently to carried research scientific .
The first type type was complete in and is launched for first increasingly the the October the . .
The lift-off had a changing the metres few cm the length and not victimised to the kg the weight .
Over afternoon is is the build the version version and in summer the is began the tests airlines the the rockets rockets the two stages in the desert the the .
The lift-off severs metres and and few remained .
Another type the lift-off in development cards to be subjected the study scientific real The lift-off lift-off cards to having a changing the km and his mission would control the wind the height .
However however in is dissatisfied the jobs .
The successor the the first rockets of type type was the lift-off lift-off that is built during the years and . .
They They as lift-off the two stages with a length total the cm and a weight initial the remained .
They proceeded three types scanners scanners scanners and and , that is differed between yes for the space available for the appliances scientists .
In the lift-off lift-off the space available for the volume was the litres in the the the litres and in the the the litres .
The changing maximum in the three types was the km .
Among the years and is developed in the Institute appraisal the lift-off lift-off whose initial tests airlines is began in October the . .
The lift-off lift-off had a weight initial the kg and was capable the wear a weight useful the kg until km the height .
Subsequently is built the version version and and .
It necessary mention also the entry the Poland in the the Open degradation degradation Roslin in the year and the training of committee national the the two years later .
In the framework of programme programme Poland is joined to the research of space space on satellite artificial Soviets and in the year , the pilot Polish Polish Polish is became in the Secondly Secondly later the Vladimir Remek .
The suspension the the law on jobs social not is the solution .
The week Last the tribunal constitutional suspended the law law social .
The resolution adherents a Non-Proliferation debate in the society .
Since then be interesting examining the document existing since a point the view more broader .
The systems economic Liberals in the EU Like that in the world globalised is based in the principle the a greater competition economic and least legislation .
In consequence this mean that the different forms economic and the systems economic national are in conflict permanent between yes .
The cause is contempt in the principle of free trade and of movement free and unlimited the capital private together with the speculation financial unbridled .
The effect the the large differences in the cost labour the the wages produces tensions economic .
Under this concept is necessary understand the situation in the that the manufacturer with the imports the goods cheap staying shorten distances and for doing &apos; causing a a &apos; of price of competitor with the objective the shouldn with the greater part of market and the this Similarly increase his margin the profits .
To great scale mean for the majority the the employers Enterprises the production the abroad buy there more cheap or well disappearing The result is a unemployment high in Especially countries in the that the price of work in comparison with other economies is more high-level .
Due to that the capital private not has responsibility social some and with doing either is responsible of unemployment that this phenomenon generated growth necessarily the expenditure social of state .
whole this situation evicted the total MG6 the the employers for pay taxes and compensate the damage economic and social that have lie in his sheer the obtain profits .
The situation is universally so known that not is necessary submit data statisticians concrete .
The practices little little of capital private Do situations in certain economies in the that the governments the these countries is Supposing forced to compete with the objective the reduce artificially the level social the the own population and the this Similarly attract capital abroad the country .
words the another function the governments correctly capital private to readiness the his own population without having in account the decline social .
This is ago patent on everything in the changes the the laws observance .
The objective is forcing to the population to that accept the dictated of capital private on everything in what that Concerning to the wages .
This has place for a part prohibited the system the duty economic in the case the unemployment the long long-term for another prohibited the right restricted the the employees in As to rights labour .
The result is a poverty growing together with the increase the the differences between poor and rich .
Since ago a series the years there in Germany points the handing the food for people poor that not can chips with his own work .
The number the people that receive this type the aid arrives already the million .
In the framework of fastest-growing the the competitiveness the the economy German is produces a case quite prevalent people undervalued with a wage so under that the state must pay the rest for reaching the minimum absolute for survive .
They did public a scandal the this type connected with the situation the the employees revelations of parliament federal German .
The measures the savings the virtually all the states of southern the the EU nowhere without place to doubt to the same situation The people repeated for a decline decline the his level social is Supposing forced to undeveloped as in the century 19th or to to with a wage rotten in the limit the the society with the expectancy the that somewhere day comes the country capital investor private .
It necessary necessary the where next .
In the case the that is instrument the other countries the the EU then the poverty passes the a country to another or not arrives never project that Chinese Indian Brazilian Turks Moroccan Egyptians or African continuing working for a tiny part the a wage European .
This also affects to across America Latin .
The Bilbao Liberals and the media the communication claim until the indicates that the state not should proof capital to the economy that directing the economy leads to his failure .
The capital private reasoning with tooth and tooth the submit the that the state not should intervene in the economy economy in the control .
To continuation is necessary one if the capital private not part with his egoism in the march policy and for make in everything the state .
In this case the answer is clearly yes .
The test is the existence the lobbies in the practice very mighty and free-trade in all the states .
The result is a situation desperation that is patent in the field the the corruption in the lobbies mutual in a legislation that is virtually reprehensible in all parties but not is offence .
In Germany the situation is the next the ministries state to lack the media financial bureaux the drafting the projects the law to companies legal private the subjects are to often linked with the industry .
This type the projects the law are Projects later in the Bundestag the parliament German .
Indeed this Similarly everything the power not choice of people stand and as is inter-institutional in the constitutions the the democracies Western but the the strong groups financial that represent their own interests .
It obvious that the democracies with a orientation liberal is trouble quickly in a situation how the that describes describes in his masterpiece The crisis the the republic Roman in times the Caesar and and &apos; The state was time time and the administrations is high-ranking to the strength &apos; .
To change the bribery lobbies gulf gulf and aid for finance stones or shabby .
The Accusations and the corruption is spread without aggressively definitely and the People Urumqui to the ballot with the vote vote the advance &apos; &apos; not had People with character that that to a project in the administration case that a increasingly to cause the this disorganisation the state National eight months without best-case &apos; &apos; schoolteacher to hears in seriously the that the unique cure for a situation so serious was the autocracy and that was necessary decisions a man solving &apos; Although Although meant in in Caesar promising the power and transformed the democracy for always in autocracy .
The conclusion of same Similarly that in the 30-year-old is that the society current is founded in preferences insensitive of benefit individual without having in account the interests common .
The capital private not is capable in his essence the understand and demand the profits the across the society .
The result is the same that the the then a colonised the the elite without unprecedented without that is investigated a effort for reforming in depth .
The causes of booming the the regimes fascist and Communist must owns for what therefore in the liberalisation unbridled the the systems economic in the century 19th and 20th .
With respect to the situation current is possible considered the disappearance the these systems in benefit the a democracy the type liberal as a pause criticise to the expected of next coup .
The fact really really is that the elite current ignores for completely the losses the hundreds the thousands in lives disasters social and humanitarian the the that have been witnessing case as the crimes against the humanity stand and as the know in the history former and the more recent .
The suspension the the law on tenders public not is the solution the least not to long-term term .
Under pressure the the competition economic therefore to level international as inside the the EU the government the the Republic Czech is taken obliged to continue for other approaches for reduce the level social the the population .
This trend is for what therefore systemic .
The solution passes for reforms reforms specific that strengthen therefore the participation of capital of state as the influence the the citizens in the government and that weaken the position the monopoly of capital private in the society in benefit of state .
Israel the laboratory of chaos .
&apos; concludes concludes concludes degradation degradation loosening loosening loosening Madam &apos; not arises nothing the the violence and nothing could do , , in his song song and whose whose others'. &apos; Cleanup la Lloyd do not not not not we canaries &apos; not us forget the what fragile that are . .
&apos; If my children not families wars not would none &apos; &apos; &apos; wife the Mayer Mayer Rothschild in his bed the death in the year . .
After the the latest waves the violence between Israel and the Strip the Gaza have mushroomed as always reactions variety .
A of hand the Israel argues to favour of right the self-defence and and to the Palestinians in the allows the terrorists The another supports to the Palestinians and lower-ranking racism for part of state the Israel genocide less against Arab Palestinians and denigrated to Israel the state terrorist .
not want turn in Who is guilty the the massacres that is echo regular and Who is the victim At end and the carried the citizens the today in day the Israel including the territories self-employed born inside the the situation policy current and not lived the auditing the the violence .
My intention is offer to the readers a scrutinise behind of curtain a scrutinise for compromising Who taxed advantage the the tensions that is prevails since ago years calculated to onwards the the declaration Balfour in November the ) in a small surface the land of Middle agreed .
Some the my considerations is based in facts historical other in conclusions to the that I arrived on the basis the my own function the understand the matter on Who or what group the people is the promote main the the events the the history modern .
In the history the the humanity the history the the struggles for the power is in first class .
In each era can find a Great Great or a Rostopchine .
But what that already not is so obvious is if always were these tyranny the that commensurate their steps the function self-governing or if behind the his Big had someone that that their actions towards a operating objective .
must accept that live in a era that policing the wealth of world in the hands the few few individuals and that to this concentration the money and the power that this involves not is has able reaching in a speak generation .
Indeed between these families families richest emphasised a that could regarded the more prominent if still there someone behind not what know but not what rule : the Rothschild .
not is says much to closely the them .
Of .
In the years of century 19th bought the first agency the news Reuters for that slave the associate his name with acts criminals the lot seriousness The power and the wealth or two them portions the wall thing that for them always meant a Increasing .
They cautiously important in almost all the banks central of world and in Especially countries in the that not are represented is has declared or is is introduce a war before of attack to Afghanistan were countries later of attack the Iraq were later the evil to Gaddafi only affected four , but interim Russia has Nothing the bank central the government Russian .
All time that has tried oppose to this family has dead .
Abraham Lincoln is refused to renew the state of bank central Bank European America the the Rothschild began during the War the Secession to print money and was murdered in in the theatre .
JFK started to print money and wanted trials the system the reserve federal preserve'of and was murdered in ; the the Louis Louis Louis was poisoned the year later the loved exceeding to the preserve'of for ought outrage the great crisis economic of year . .
Their sheer for the power global them subsequently during the years - to agenda a plan with three wars world designed for the the Shaw Pike Vichy with the rise . .
The first war is espoused as objective eliminate the large states states in across Europe the second wanted eliminate the formed colonial particularly the Great Britain and the third is proposed reduce the population the the land between half million and thousand million the people way amount the slave for his welfare and luxury sufficient and not not many resources , addition the the creation the a religion universal the the not is nothing more that a resembles for way solution and the adoption final the the powers six-month .
The method with the that operates the group the the families more richest together with the Rothschild continues the dynamic of releasing the crisis and the post-Gaddafi Thank the a solution solution solution solution agenda to onwards of chaos . .
These solutions are without however flawed and chemicals always a worsening the the situation If not enough remember that the preserve'of was created for that not is repetition a crisis as the of year . .
So that after the success of murder of Big the Big elicited Archduke Ferdinand in Sarajevo and later the that to root the doing is erupted the First War World tore the Russia Eduard with the beginning the the revolution Bolshevik .
The First War World Bolkestein'is the function unexpectedly and unjustified since the point the view military and economic the capitulation the Germany the wars for overcome with the Russia Eduard were already unnecessary and the post-Gaddafi break-up the the great power the Europe Central the empire empire .
For preparation the ground the the Second War World allowed that the bankers and politicians palette the Similarly bloodless a situation upheaval to root the the enormous loan the war imposed on Germany with what that is laid the conditions privileged for the radicalisation the the mob impoverished Subsequently them sufficient with The to the Germans the solution of of that was what enough strong and simple and respectable to guilty and build later a Czechoslovakia states for several communism with a strong minority German that publishes 84 and appropriations so well the function the the fifth spine that that the way and Enquiry the outbreak the the war .
At late of century 19th the Rothschild Rothschild the foundation of movement movement a resources that increase to the training the a state Jewish preferably in the region the the former former with Jerusalem as capital return the the . .
The declaration Balfour linkage previously sit the foundations for the immigration mass the Jews to Palestine and detected the first conflicts with the population Arab of place .
They produced attacks terrorists in sides parties .
parties the Second War World is difficult know if Hitler commissioned too the the merry to the that what ones control the bankers international in a principle or if everything what that did draft part the a plan However however the suffering the the Jews Europeans in the camps the concentration creation the conditions privileged for the acceptance of state Jewish in the society global .
Israel was founded officially in and the Similarly similar the Similarly in that the loan the war imposed to Germany Exports the road towards the Second War World with the proclamation of state the Israel is creation the spotlight for a third war .
If the bankers international succeed succeed the nation Jewish the Like that in the Second War World is generate in victim in first online the combat now together with the population Arab or generally Muslim of Middle agreed .
Israel is a laboratory relapse a machine the solder and chaos not only in the framework the his country but also to scale international Take as example how is earmarked the Similarly totally the abolish and opponents the Israel .
Who is guilty and Who is the victim in the conflict Israeli-Palestinian So Where the injustice rise injustice in a spiral the violence chestnut if the beginning the everything was the greed the some individuals and his sheer for the power global .
In this point is necessary distinction between the inhabitants the Israel and their responsibly because the Like that happens in our country the bankers international only similar to their candidates in the elections .

Film ARGO If is puts crude elsewhere to Hollywood .
In November the a group the the demonstration the students Islamists occupied the Embassy American in Tehran and three-and-a-half three-and-a-half as hostage .
Their Decommissioning in freedom cards to be to change of of of Shia Shia Shia the opened later the the revolution Pamuk to USA country that had had his regime during decades .
For the administration American the situation not option none perspective positive bath-water the the for the EU-Mexico not is what could.&apos; allowing project that if what was disposal in danger the confidence the their allies in other countries .
But the Decommissioning in freedom the the hostage in Iran where the revolution had led in the constitution of regime theocratic not was to his reach .
was a coup the prestige the the States United that subsequently is Valencia still more with the attempt upcoming the free to the hostage for the strength .
The diplomats imprisoned were released days later the the intervention negotiating of government the Algeria .
In US his destination horrible a wave the solidarity and ill-will against Iran .
The failure in Iran played the function decisive to the defeat the Jimmy Jimmy cope Ronald Ronald in the elections presidential the . .
The film &apos; ARGO &apos; of director and actor Ben Ben Ben a episode the this history that that a small success for America .
Little before the occupy the Embassy is escaped six employees of building .
After the a complicated complicated ended in the residence the the Embassy Canadian .
CIA in collaboration with the authorities Canadians managed extract the Iran for doing helped a history backdoor a point point consequently with passports Canadians as Member of team film that looked the traceability in the country for the Could the a producing the science fiction .
fiction the gender .
The plan that Bourlanges the expert in &apos; &apos; &apos; &apos; &apos; coordinated the collaboration the Hollywood .
For that the lie prompt divulged is wrote on the project film in journals specialist is organised conferences the press the society the production virtual had even a clearance real .
The details on the operation is Shah in secret during much time the film is has fact to onwards the the memories the Tony Tony .
The film the the is a combination odd the several gender .
For a hand a a political realistic for another a so-called &apos; &apos; &apos; &apos; the history the a episode that went well a deception a example can be the series series la Lloyd Lloyd . .
In the film is combined the states the mind Similar for a hand hand well substantiated the Tehran In the sequence the appropriations is keen photographs flagship the the era the the events that were were of same Similarly in the film not there many differences to this regard .
For the another scenes authoritarian the Hollywood a therefore more more marked for the irony and a corner excessive .
And addition scenes the the central the the CIA and other institutions men men that analyse the situation in the table the negotiations in the corridors the the office for telephone .
Ben Ben has managed restart his career the a Similarly excellent .
The actor that had been subjected the mocked is has become in a director respectable and his Similarly the act has last the be the white the comments ironic .
ARGO is his Thirdly Thirdly later the &apos; welcome small welcome &apos; preparing and the the &apos; chosen chosen City the honour &apos; Exclusion . .
At same time is the first film the the in the that the action not has place in the city the the where is fattened .
also the sensitivity the everyone's the atmosphere of place was a feature that footing to the directors the films ancient for above the standards the Hollywood .
And And what shows in ARGO where Tehran is &apos; wheel &apos; in Canada .
The best scenes the the film have place in the streets in the reconstruction the the events reported The sequence introductory the the decision-making the the Embassy is impressive for his capacity capacity that the same time time the ambivalent of Confusion and the the lack the foresight that arises when in somewhere place the history five-minute a step forward .
forward and their colleagues obtaining a effect similar in the scenes over-imaginative the team team in the bazaar the Tehran . .
This action in Too places .
The director had that accept the fact the that a history explained not provides much in the sense film the the scenes more schemers .
And is the You quite well To sometimes him adds something to the reality here not its everything the Similarly so lobster the scene in that threatens the crisis in the airport the Tehran the Deviating the a so-called to America and the search unbridled after his track is occurrence in a madness . .
The The the ARGO is the havoc that arises the the need the show &apos;I action in Too places .
Alan Alan and John John have a role very funny as colleagues the Hollywood although their tyranny is deserved more space and not are nor much least the ones in this this .
For these reasons the film the the lose a little the sketch dramatic but is a a that is can continue with a interest moderate appreciate his realisation and the lifestyle lifestyle the a a that beautiful the years . .
But that is collapse that be difficult .
As Grand the a history real and as test the what excessive that can be the outmoded the the and and the the services secret is enough .
enough for the the the promising cotton and circus .
The servant servant that each year where a survey on the rates bank more absurd now has decided announce the Contest on &apos; the regulation or the ideas more absurd of workshop the the EU &apos; .
&apos; They us happened later of Finally event the EU has scheduled approve a quota of for cent the women in jobs the direction in the large companies European &apos; mover mover Lindén Lindén the inflated the the survey .
Among the the the is for example the recent decision of court European the unify the Rhineland the insurance between men and women .
far now the women is is the best prices in the insurance the life because represent objective a risk unemployed .
&apos; Others ideas influenced of workshop the the EU can be proposals for the People until late the this year &apos; .
The election noon place to final of month the February the &apos; reported reported .
Among the regulations controversial the the EU is for example the addition compulsory the the the fuel that as result harms the half environment another ban is the spatial the the thermometers the mercury the across the life only because contain a small amount the a substance dangerous or the Guideline Guideline the size the the cages the the hens that has contributed the fastest-growing considerable of price the the eggs this year .

The aircraft the the Union decision-making this type the decisions to often under the pressure the each or another lobby Treasury or industrial whose petitions in Brussels are ideas normally for somewhere state or group the states the Republic Czech even with the threat the veto eye the demands the their banks . .
The interests the a lobby were behind the the request for example the that the bananas the greater quality running having in the EU a length the for what least centimetres and not could submit &apos; &apos; abnormal &apos; .
The Commission European is coccidiostats fights that with this only search harmonisation the rules national not not until the date that only only his marketing .
The rules that for reference to fruit and vegetables in the EU to despite the the opposition the some states is have relaxation on the basis the that the directive existing realises a waste the grocery .
The candidate to win the survey could be the remote the the upholds of year past according the opened in the promising promising that is notably is compulsory themes that the children minors the years not are authorised to to without the supervision the a adult .
The upholds was reference here to a study American according the opened when is talks the toys the promising are the main cause the death infant for asphyxia .

years years born even in our country .
Similarly absurd is the regulation announce to the officials Europeans everything time that purchase some function official in the EU not can use the designation the Macedonia For not euphemisms the sensitivity the Greece is must talk the FYROM Republic Republic Republic European Macedonia . .
The servant servant in collaboration with the partnership the economists Liberals Liberals Liberals Liberals in the survey between some proposals absurd COMs more upwards the remote the the Union on the volume the the provisions the food in the territory the a state member .
The EU EU the volumes device the provisions the food that can technically in the territory the the Republic Czech the same day the our entry to the EU .
After the Republic Czech Estimated for example the volume established for for in retains what that him did a threat the fined substantial .
To the organizers the the survey also them crusades the Forced the pay to Especially countries that not Rather access the sea and the idea the Priority a subsidy for the request the subsidies .

According According prioritised that the Republic Czech is far the the ports maritime the EU should should hundreds the million the EUR .
At final the Commission European is daring ready to help to the Republic Czech and organised a Contest public for the buying of crop the the countries that not have access the sea .
The subsidy for receiving a subsidy was proposal to the municipalities for the ministry for the development local booklet for the minister minister minister minister precludes is aimed to the drafting the applications the subsidies the Brussels . .
EU The half-hearted rare are a exception .
The guidelines the the states Member are to often white the criticisms the efforts the the EU in fight the unhealthy and also a functioning and development more effective in across the Union deserve more well according several experts our recognition .
According the experts the problem more serious is for example the collection the subsidies the the EU for projects that not have nothing that see with the deepening the the integration European but that the states Member have managed in the negotiations on budgets .
To the Czech also them heart the flax sensitive of same Similarly that to other countries the the Union the fight for the right to the designation the origin the their products traditional although our country not always hear won DE the these these .
The Czech after six years the disputes with Germans and Austrian Bolshevik with success the designation the origin of of the the but resulted that christening the name the rum national whose tradition in our country is dates the century 19th and Commissioner's to unfair &apos; &apos; &apos; .

The People wants that Save the republic but am a amateur claims claims .
Mr Senator So how is him happened stand to the elections for president .
not is talking the be Senator or president .
If in our country outside everything well then not introduce my candidacy .
But already not can bear see how is monies in the recent twenty years in our country how the honour left unpunished is increases the taxes and the age the retirement .
not had ambitions the be political .
When see something that not me like attempt give with a solution for amended .
And project that already have Forty years and my candidacy is independent the unique possibility that have the change the things is imagine as Senator or president .
At Senate already has arrived but little later is has project in road towards the presidency .
not is turning the backs to temporarily people that what have voted .
always spotted that my candidacy to the presidency depended the the results in the elections of senate .
Over afternoon afternoon that if cowardly elected Senator introduce my candidacy to the presidency .
But my objective not is the function the function is the tool with the that can do reality my Their ideas .
For that need the greater influence possible and the mandate more strong possible .
The problem not is only that may a nation that criticize in the bar or front the the television but that that to anybody that wants begin a change .
To this is him at-risk the media the communication that you discredit and confusing the freedom the expression with the freedom the lying .
Indeed me is says that I I to journalists or that I been advisory the Paroubek Paroubek .
Are to talk the their ideas .
They where to the fight presidential with submit financial and responsibilities criminal the politicians and the declaration the the property for above the twenty million .
For doing must change the law .
As president not has this competition and only the senate in his whole can propose laws .
How wants resolve .
As citizen I formed part the a group the pressure for that the profession the guide is recommend as work decentralised and what succeeded .
The problem is in the policy if someone arrives with a good proposal already make the right-wing or the left-wing is decline to purpose and this affects to the citizens .
As candidate independent correspondence the a greater potential for obtain the support the all the groups parliamentary .
However However nor undistorted the party have the capacity the power decisions something the each party that make best for our country and apply .
They viewed more well a man the right-wing or the left-wing .
Since the point the view Czech have the impression that the People me viewed more the left-wing .
For me not has importance already make a little the left-wing or a little the right-wing .
applies that me care is that emerge forward .
not me care if someone is the right-wing or the left-wing want abreast to the People .
always support openly any solution good regardless the if the proposal next of of or the the ODS and of same Similarly Unless in against the the bad ideas .
ago joke when is says the the that is populist .
But not what is demonstrating with what that says .
When is creates a plan business for the company future also revealed objectives and ideals .
E E E to them .
Will who what called populism but all the proposals the the that am already work in the world or known experts Talk the them .
But without the support of parliament only him left slogans .
And with doing not can survive in the policy to long-term term .
Or believes you that if is aimed to the people and talks with them adequately for example a responsibility criminal and financial .
not have another option .
option to politicians to journalists and to the society civil and try unilaterally the my part for do .
If outside elected president not would problem in organise a Europe-wide in direct for television in the opened Southern to the leaders the the parties parliamentary that that the responsibility criminal and financial for politicians officials judges and prosecutors of state .
And eventually them sooner that communicate why not what want .
If there a personage strong that Other the disputes is can do pressure in the scene policy .
Take for case the election direct of president that has been a achievement the the pressure public .
At same time ours that only am a amateur not am nor a bottle nor a intellectual .
For my views and ideals attempt seek allies .
hoc the begin in the policy and attempt obtain the greater support possible for my programme .
defend cash the things forward I same but in case the that not charters well inside the six years what leave and go the sector private .
sounds a little as if if outside to save the Republic Czech .
not am circumstances circumstances .
beliefs that with a person not successfully nothing for that I visited to a series the personalities known for if to what best is is to submit his candidacy the senate .
elation to see to to to but is refused because had much work .
For my part for what least I supported to the journalist the research research research that witch to the light the fraud with cheeses commercial the heating .
I together plainly the the basis the that the People is really dissatisfied now am in the balance .
The Sixty for cent the the population not turned to the ballot and Especially that what Those voted to the representatives of yobs .
In the senate are two of sector independent .
The People checked the senate the stand Similarly that be complicated achieve changes .
However however I defend my Their ideas as for example the election direct the mayors or the governors .
Has considering fortunate his own party .
still not what I considered because not have time for doing for check the past unblemished the each each the the transmission Member of party nor either have money .
not have money nor for the campaign to the presidency in my account transparent only there NOK .
not has money .
centralisation the statements the the property So how is the yours .
clarification my property private in few million .
In Prague have a ground valued in million a floor valued ten million another floor floor in eight million a series the works the art with a value the ten million a a Martin the few million and a a a valued in a million and in the account have a couple the million .
For true have a a Martin because was my dream the youth always me about James madman that Berg-Petržalka this car was was with the women and the same time elites against the the and injustices .
injustices a a Martin his property is valued in million and not has money for the campaign .
campaign says that wants change the republic but not wants put too money the his part .
not is very convincing .
not have million for the campaign .
I that that .
In the campaign already I project million .
The fact the that not purchase circumstances circumstances shows that not there too interest in my programme .
And not have the duty the pay the campaign with money the my pocket .
The expenses the the campaign expressed in essence what that detailed in concept the salary the Senator .
But not could live the doing For example not could pay to my son the school English that costs NOK month .
If like just win money then not me introduce as candidate .
So that here with his activity business for power live .
not has said before that cards to stop this activity .
This not has nothing that see with a salary greater .
As I promised in part I last my activities .
For example the representative the my agency the travel examined to be my substitute in spring .
The People problem that outside the the that that the republic .
But I also need live the something .
How loosen to win monthly as entrepreneur .
Among and , that am gaining .
If outside president then commodities the business .
Can obligatory across the interview in the edition of Saturday the the .
The study the architecture architecture shows that the real adventures not only are in the head in the example the the library the the and the newly draw &apos; mountain the books &apos; &apos; photos .
&apos; believe that the building is fun has a aspect aspect and for end there something interesting that see &apos; claims claims claims a passer-by that passes for the street .
And Stefan Stefan technical the IT in a great company Administrative closely the the library urgency &apos; addition the building is really &apos; .
But I me wonder for what need a library today in day .
all have Internet chlorine and books electronic .
Nobody enters for tailor-make in matters libraries big the fashionable So not .
not a city bedroom Administrative to the doors the nursing that hardly deserves a a visit holds the questionable honour the been levies with a record for forget .
The population the inhabitants where the rate the literacy more low the the Netherlands Netherlands .
For counter this situation so scandal ago some years is decided contribute the some function to the culture general and imitation the seven bridges People-trafficking that paper represented in the notes the euro in manner the the the concrete arm arm .
The success the the offensive amusing was limited .
And case was as the responsible politicians keeper that only existed a possibility for improve the statistics generalized had that build a library .
library library of study the architecture Dutch Dutch everything a proxy in the art the the the the bars and responsible the buildings funny to the couple that Quai is three-and-a-half the subject with his become calm and Dalmau to the presentation of Contest in the year with five books under the satisfactorily and a rights in the repatriated .
And while the jury jury Oswiecim to his around and is is the shoulders shoulders 17,900 to blown the books for size soul a pyramid and completed his brief speech with the follows words &apos; Dear fellow .
Here the suits my proposal for the mountain the books the the the called called la &apos; .
Nine years later the mountain the million the EUR is comments in the place scheduled .
That manner part of project the revival that is top-to-toe with a parking underground a supermarket a office the post and a couple the buildings the housing and and .
To principles the November the mountain the books was medallists with the Secondly award &apos; Best Best European NL &apos; .
Moreover the project also is is the &apos; &apos; National National National &apos; .
Indeed this manner the small city sake the history that until the date not had nothing more that offer that a zone smartest smartest and a City incredibly liver-stained after whose façade cheque each each more well a central farm account now with a masterpiece the architecture contemporary .
But on everything everything disposal now of first building cultural public the his history .
The long-term road until the book .
The first impression is that is talking the a paradise the books under a a .
Well is true that there a lift that us stored fair the centre the this Hallandsåsen Hallandsåsen but the culprits admirers of space and the reading not what guns but that prefer prefer with his his to each step the his escalation to the top .
The internal completely completely is celebrity and easy the postal with the view the soil the mortar mortar and the elegant elegant support the manner unequivocally the condition public the the library .
The environment urban is perfect .
At raise the view is can reaching to to the banks of park the dogs and the children and girls playing the football .
And for all Criminals books books and more books .
&apos; usually the shelves the books are Conversely to what long-term the the façade and in the centre is opens a enormous room brown-skinned that for what general always be something lecturing and impersonal &apos; claims claims claims .
applies that have fact us is put upside upwards the classical configuration body and cash the zone the reading of internal the external .
The internal the the mountain is very well tapped in the half is lie the offices the library the Internet the club the chess the centre the education environmental and the room the peacekeeping .
drama special deserve the shelves blackest that tries the functions the coating coating coating and and the same time .
The view the identified and the the are strangers .
Even the architects and the engineers civilians more the day shake the head when shrieked talk the this material unknown .
&apos; wanted work with materials recycled &apos; us explains explains explains head of project in the city the the .
And case is as a day in a exploitation agricultural agricultural us alone with the non-food adequate alert the the agriculture .
Since ago many years in the greenhouses and in the camps the the Netherlands Netherlands is used a fabric plastic the scarce millimetres the thick as basis for for the roots the the crops .
They talking the a material cheap and efficient .
This fabric fine repressed two stations and later is battled .
For the library this fabric is is for first increasingly in such quantities until achieving Illustrations the four centimetres the thick .
With the heat and the pressure the so-called plastic agricultural agricultural changing the colour and is becomes in a material dark border-transcending and durable that smacks to a mixture the car new and and the sport .
After frontage is arrives to the top the the mountain .
At final the this route continual the almost metres around the the mountain us Great the reward since the cafeteria not only is has a fantastic view the the city but that in her also is can enjoy the should Cheap Cheap budgeting and their their acres in enormous pots .
These Do a environment atmosphere to the couple that Other the moisture air suitable for this mountain the literature .
literature for a new soul .
&apos; Although whatever to light their large aside glass this building is a project exemplary in what that Concerning to the ecology &apos; Other Other .
The heating and the cooling necessary is Usually to onwards the energy geothermal .
To despite the that the mountain the books is Administrative under a enormous pyramid the glass even in the days more more the sun only Maputo during few hours in his internal .
The enormous enormous the wood enacted in sense transversal to the façade the glass serve for give shadow and absorb the majority the the rays of sun .
This creates a climate internal internal .
The rest is thing the the pulled automatic .
Stefan Stefan the scepticism worker of sector the the technologies the the Information already is has courage to put the ordinary in the new library .
And And And also has state there .
Similarly the teacher the medicine traditional Chinese Cynthia Cynthia has visited the library She status the &apos; &apos; &apos; as the &apos; soul belatedly &apos; the the .
The reason is that with reason the the opening that had place ago a couple the weeks is invited to all the inhabitants the the city to donate a book the his series private .
Indeed this manner is intended fill the moment the bits bits the a library that still not account with his archive completely in the currently has copies .
The concept has assertions celebration .
The shelves are teem .
&apos; not there nothing worst that a library half empty &apos; claims the architect architect architect .
&apos; believe that thanks to our initiative now all the inhabitants have a true link with this building .
all know that his book manner part the the library .
Although only protecting Hence for anti-farming .
Indeed this manner the study study has managed everything a success in that discipline dominated that in the the specialises is knows as &apos; creation the a identity &apos; .
The city the the has writing a part the the history the the literature .
Regardless the what young and and that conclusion be .
For end a point the starting for shaping his identity .
identity &apos; The Germans must vital a role more regard &apos; .
Germany is has abstained in the vote on the admission the Palestine .
According Stephen Stephen expert in the relations USA USA this puts to Berlin in a position diplomatic quite tricky .
Deutsche Deutsche To principles the week Germany only to understand that shadow in against the the proposal the grant to the territories Palestinians the condition the State observer the the Nations UN .
However however finally Berlin is abstained .
For what .
Stephen Stephen Germany not supports what that the Israelis have fact in Gaza .
Now well due to the relationship special that unite the country with Israel Germany must having care .
But the same time believe that either supports the position fooled .
Germany wanted demonstrate his independence without be too criticism with Israel .
During the upheaval that had place in Libya in March the , Germany also is abstained when the what that is breadth was the establish a zone the ban the flight .
That has been malpractice finally for the NATO .
Le is difficult to Germany adopt a position clear when are in game subjects international important .
Yes case is .
This is must to that in these moment is hindrance his policy external intergovernmental the a policy clean-up for case say for the States United and fellow in a policy external German .
And what that lengthy still more the things is that the Europeans not have a policy coherent and uniform .
For what therefore the Germans is lie in a crossroads .
Indeed them is expected that archives a allows more independent but not are numbers to do .
believe that still are appears what be his role but already have initiated the road towards a policy external &apos; normal &apos; .
A policy external similar to the countries as France or Great Britain .
What mean specifically a policy external &apos; normal &apos; since the point the view German .
It a policy that when is talking the interests national is shows ready to defend clash different to the the States United or their partners Europeans .
believe that the policy external German position a strong motivation in the policy economic is say in the exports and in their relations with certain regions as can be Russia China or Middle Middle .
The interests economic Germans are until true point different to the the other large powers and for that reason Germany must protect their interests .
These interests economic have clearly in the position adopted with regard the conflict in Middle Middle and in the vote the the UN .
For a hand Germany account with large markets in Middle Middle particularly in the Gulf .
For this reason must be sustainably and not alienate the the opinion public Arab nor either the the élite Arab .
This is important for course .
But I not him virtual never importance project that not is talking the a relationship completely unilateral .
However however yes context a role fundamental in the considerations German .
He re-establish Germany his relationship with USA Compared the abstain the vote in important decisions as in the vote on Palestine .
believe that in Europe and even in States United the position German enjoyed the a enormous rise the understanding .
For this reason not believe that is hear produced a break so drastic as in the case the Libya .
Perhaps with doing Germany hear achieved Torquemada a true respect .
At end and the carried everything this not has fact but demonstrate that is a country the that Take in seriously as actor international and whose interests there that having in account .
In Europe there different views onset the the initiative Palestinian .
In change USA Compared is has shown clearly to favour the a veto .
There differences the views between USA Compared and many nations European .
always have Therefore these disparities due to the policy internal US .
believe that the government the Obama shows in secret a great understanding towards the position European .
But to cause the the situation policy that is lives here is obvious that the government not can defend in public that position .
believe that the genuine differences the views not has in reality the perceive that is him attaches .
If enormous the relations between Obama and the Prime Minister Israeli Netanyahu see that Obama not is for nothing himself with the policy that develops .
Le is difficult to Germany reconcile the struck relations that keeps with Israel and States United for a hand with the position the their main partners in the EU for another .
believe that is precisely that what that ago that make so difficult for the Germans .
For course that would a little more easy for the Germans if existed a policy European coherent and allowing but not is the case .
For what therefore not have the possibility the fortunate part the a broadcasting higher but that must speed the things since his own position .
That is precisely what that are doing now with the euro .
believe that in the future Germany financed a role the leadership to the hour the forcing to Europe to adopt a position European .
For course that this not is nothing easy for Germany already make simply for the relationship that keeps with Israel .
This has been always a subject handles .
But believe that the Germans have clear that must vital the role the Through independent .
They sees Germany to yes same in the role the actor international important So Does in reality Germany assume a role regard .
Or perhaps him continues underdeveloped difficult accept that leadership .
Germany still not is has Fitoussi always is something embarrassed and for reasons obvious the country him continues costing vital a role more important .
If saw the crisis of euro for example see that each increasingly that Germany is fighters as actor main is yielding revealed feelings feelings .
This not is easy for the Germans .
They talking the a old problem and is that nobody wants be surrounded the the countries enemies .
Seen the this manner Germany is position in a position much more difficult that States United .
must show a attitude inclusive cope to the different neighbours and views and that not is easy .
The influence the USA Compared in the policy European tonight each increasingly more but the EU not cover the moment that gap So Who remains then .
To the Germans not them considerable more cure that assume a role more regard .
Even if not them like if them is unpleasant or if them becomes in a people still more unpopular c la &apos;est the vie .

&apos; Protection the trademark &apos; in China when when and Rolex is occurrence the suddenly in trademark Chinese .
Rolex is a brand known to level global and Pole Pole Pole also .
But So what is Rolex Pole .
After this name is behind a designation the officially in China but that not has nothing that see with the companies original .
not However one enjoyed the protection while the culprits culprits not jointly a demand .
E even then not is clear that is them demands to give the reason .
&apos; To the foreign them is each increasingly more difficult protect their trademark in China &apos; Other Greek Greek lawyer of of Taylor Taylor specialises in violations the rights the protection in Far Middle .
Every week arrives to my table a new case .
The imitators simply Four a couple the irrelevant for power record their trademark .
Indeed this manner manner is becomes in in and in place the the is bankruptcies bankruptcies .
The companies German also is copied legally the the same function stand and as him has happened the manufacturer the articles sports sports .
sports opens a filing in the that unrelated seats the the office the trademark the Beijing .
The the September the a company Chinese Full record the brand brand brand brand a name artificial that also is useless the the house the fashionable fashionable fashionable .
can the Chinese are champions world in that the imitation and the violate the rights the property intellectual is the well-known known .
In the large cities there large stores the several plants dedicated exclusively to the sale the counterfeiting .
However however the cases the the are the another kettle For bookshop the their customers him fight against the fact the that the office the trademark solve the manner official to the companies Chinese the right to cash advantage the a designation that already is the in another place .
The Chinese what call &apos; &apos; &apos; &apos; &apos; or brand incapacity .
The word has his origin in the term Chinese &apos; &apos; &apos; &apos; .
that ago reference to women that have &apos; fish &apos; to a man wealthy .
The authorities Chinese not is feel guilty .
&apos; It harmful for the bn there that fight against doing &apos; requires requires .
&apos; The brand ago waters the position monopolist disappears and the harm that suffering the image is enormous &apos; .
The losses financial and the coast procedural the the sectors affected are are on everything in the case the products flagship the luxury .
According data the the company the analysis the market market with a volume the million the EUR the year China is in size the Thirdly market the articles the luxury and the that growth to greater pace .
However however achieve the written-off the enrolment the dubious legality in the registration the trademark is complicated and addition supposed much money .
The processes is can expectancies until nine years and the result is uncertain .
uncertain talks the cases in the that the court rejected a demand because had Reforms therefore time that the name subjected the the demand already is had become in a &apos; reality the market &apos; .
&apos; If the claimant has bad Fortunately perhaps even purchase that pay money the the because the process has damage to the brand the unknown in China &apos; Other Other .
In occasions this is the law the the jungle .
Some the the cases more known have that see with elements graphic .
In In lost a Greek against the manufacturer the machinery the construction construction the company that has been Bridgwater ago little for the manufacturer German the bombs the concrete concrete .
For that to day the today the Chinese can continue reported a emblem very similar to the star the Mercedes .
The buyer the Umeå Umeå ounces the principle a logo in white and blue that raising in great measure to BMW the matter is is in the courts and and had that amend .
The manufacturer the clothes clothes lost in China against imitators originating the Kong Kong and Singapore whose logo doubt a crocodile eye in the direction opposite the original .
The authorities Chinese not is feel guilty .
The office the trademark trademark in Beijing recognises that in have had difficulties due to the shortage the equipment and staffing the personal .
The year past without however &apos; the situation the emergency labour returned to the normal &apos; .
Indeed this manner the amount the processes the complaint without without is has reduced in a % .
Almost the these cases is properly solved a % more that the year previous .
However however however complaints continuing outstanding the resolution .
Combating against this costs much money .
As always be become in China the figures are surprising .
The year past the the recorded more the million the applications the protection the trademark almost a one-third more that in . .
They blocking the a new record and mean that China China for tenth year running the list the new enrolment in everything the world according Other the office the trademark .
seems that this also happens with the number the stitched valid figure that 27 to million in total .
In is would would million the donated in concept the rights .
words the another manner this mean that the average each register costs donated or EUR .
Combating against this costs much money stand and as shows the case the the company family German German .
Since ago more the seven years the group principal in the courts against a a Chinese .
If well the Germans have managed stopping the manufacture illegal the parts the car the imitation .
the the has achieved assured the rights Chinese on the brand brand .
&apos; We ourselves have lie this situation because in Germany the surnames not are protected &apos; Other Other Other President and and and the the the the in Munich .
The office the trademark trademark also rejected the resource the the the .
In the two follows presidents him have prioritised the reason to to but the part opposite continues fronts in the currently .
There that having regret care .
Now the case has arrived to the doors of Court Supreme the Justice where continues outstanding the resolution .
resolution entrusts in power resolve welcome the issue and extolls the professionalism the the courts .
However however also claims that &apos; the procedure is extremely expensive therefore in terms the money as the time &apos; .
hard difficult estimate the costs internal the archive business has had that review dossiers the until hundred years the 30-year-old for power proof tests .
ago five years years promised to the part opposite a &apos; sum the six figures in EUR &apos; with the objective the reaching to a agreement friendly but not had success .
&apos; This shows what much that us care &apos; Other Other .
The dangers that sub-continent in Far Middle threat even with whatsoever to Europe .
specifically if the imitators is fairly there the rights on trademark not protected .
So a manufacturer Chinese tried record in Germany the name name for shoes and products the fur .
ago time that the group Pan this field commercial not However annexed prevent the register .
&apos; There that having regret care &apos; claims claims .
Both him as the lawyer lawyer estimated to the companies German that is extremely careful to the hour the do business with China .
not enough with rely in the legislation international on rights the brand but that what that there that do is &apos; record also in China everything achieved that conclusion be retrofitting the protection &apos; stand and as urgency urgency .
Indeed what contrary the subject can infected much more expensive that a simple registration .
Indeed fact in case the that that varied the Finally assault the his battle particular then doing that pay to the part opposite rights the licence for his own name stand and as explains explains .
That or in the segment in issue us us of market .
Day global the the fight against the AIDS dance lottery help .
In Druckmaschinen trying the Whitehead Whitehead and in Swaziland is delighted the orphans of AIDS .
The history the a link capable the that overcome much more the kilometres the distance .
First is starts for the floor shoes the the Suspected the basketball shoes the the and and looking the compass on the soil the the and what lie quickly .
A two three four .
Only then Wynn to to slowly the voices the the singers singers under statement and and and , , and and should to other .
And And And the director the years threat with one's almost the their pushing the try put agenda with his gestures you.&apos; and softer .
It Monday for the afternoon and in the room the music of Institute the the the the Druckmaschinen the Whitehead Whitehead trying a new song .
also have arrived the fifty singers the between and years since the the human until the looking the house .
&apos; &apos; la la &apos; not is a piece easy each voice of Whitehead has a text different and addition in a language foreign hardly known the the a language spoken for eleven million the people in South Botswana Lesotho Malawi Mozambique and in some areas the Swaziland .
Aid for the Self-help .
According a estimate the UNAIDS the programme the the Nations UN for the fight against the AIDS in everything the world there approximately million the people infected for the virus of HIV .
million the them sub-Saharan in the southern the Africa .
In Swaziland there orphans of AIDS .
Over of % the the population already is positive .
The partnership partnership degradation Africa has met in Germany peacemaker for the orphans of AIDS of people the the .
Seventy the them Almost to the school secondary .
For or EUR the month is can can to a child .
This point cover the discharge the the school the uniform and him ensure a food hot the day in the the Center .
Center mean in in &apos; &apos; the stories &apos; or &apos; &apos; &apos; .
In this room nobody knows talk with fluidity this language language but lottery yes know .
Since ago ten years this Whitehead trying songs in this &apos;Softly language foreign that in occasions failure failure to his place the origin the southern the Africa .
To kilometres the distance in online straight since Druckmaschinen in the north-east of wealth the Swaziland exists a people so-called so-called that depends the the voices the this Whitehead German .
The Forty for cent is epidemics .
Around people sub-Saharan there some still in surgery ravines the settlement and hay a great part the them are children .
Over the already not have parents because have succumbed the AIDS .
AIDS is a small example the what that affects to Swaziland the rate the infection the AIDS more high-speed and the hopes the life more lowest the everything the world according certificate .
The population not sees with good eyes the circumcision a practice that according is has demonstrated reduces to the half the risk the infection .
Over of % the the inhabitants the Swaziland are Without of virus the the line and die with something more the thirty years is has become in something become .
During a journey whole to Africa in the spring the the Whitehead Potočnik this this population but what that saw on everything were many children in the streets that condemned not only the the protection the their parents but the what main food clothes and training .
However title school the possibilities in a country poor are more that bleak .
In a principle was solely the compromise particular the few few what that was possible that a child outside the school and and the a food hot the day All this for few few EUR .
However however a year later the Whitehead Atatürk the partnership &apos; &apos; degradation Africa &apos; that since then is has occupied occupied the the orphans of AIDS in in .
Deeds on the infections the transmission sexual .
What are the main diseases the transmission sexual .
Among the incidence the origin origin are the identifying the chlamydia and the the .
The incidence the origin origin more arise are the AIDS the virus of papilloma human the the mutilation or the hepatitis .
The The and the the is lie between the incidence airborne for parasites .
What are the main groups the affected .
The identifying and the the is babies with more often in men that Other relations sex with other men .
The Institute Robert Robert part the the basis the that the least four the each five cases the identifying handle in Germany have his origin in a contact sexual between men .
In the case the the adults adults the diseases the transmission sexual more arise are the infections for chlamydia chlamydia the virus of papilloma human the the the and the the .
The infection of HIV between the adults adults of country is relatively There not However approximately the % the the new infections for HIV is marked in this group .
Among the young the infections for chlamydia are much more arise that in other groups the population .
According polls European three quarters the all the infections affecting to young the between and years .
In our country the virus of papilloma human also is adds to the diseases more arise between the youth .
How has evolved the number the infections .
not all the diseases the transmission sexual are subject to declaration compulsory .
According the Institute Robert Robert the number the infections for identifying has doubled his figure the cases in to cases in . .
The number the new infections for HIV keeps a trend downward since . .
In is registered approximately cases .
They talking the a tenth part least that in the year previous .
What symptoms indicate that is talking the a disease disease .
The diseases infectious can provoke provoke in the zone mutilation bother the the flow pain pain case as as or or .
To often not cause pain nor rights other symptoms and for that not is stem .
How is can each protect .
The Condoms can reduce the risk the infection but not offered protection the hundred for hundred .
Some agents wildfire the diseases the transmission sexual also can transferred to via the infections for for and for contact physical .
For this reason the experts estimated Sanctions regularly to examinations doctors on everything if is changing with often the partner sexual .
If is diagnosed the manner Children the majority the the incidence can cured and is possible avoid any consequence belatedly .
To via the institutionalised donations and for Finally but not for doing least important the the refunded that citizens the Whitehead for their actions in across Germany best-seller to custom quite money .
&apos; In total have willing already few EUR to to &apos; Other proud Annette Annette chairman the the partnership .
In the own people people Gugu a woman safe the yes same and with rhetoric the leadership administers the money willing since Germany .
They ranks the that the orphans trouble a good sanitation for example with a the the grandmothers .
The &apos; &apos; &apos; as is shape to the women elderly in in are the pillars of people .
Some the them have until orphans to his office them offered a ceiling where live and is 59 the that the children matured to the school all the days punctually and orange-coloured with their uniform .
The that not have to nobody left under the protection the the a woman unmarried that the Like that the two two that is bureaux the cooking all the days for more the children hungry made a wage the the partnership .
Moreover &apos; &apos; European Africa &apos; has project in march a school the remnant has built two two and in collaboration with the organisation health US US has achieved that many the the inhabitants of people is Europe subjected to a test the HIV .
This not is something obvious project that to despite the what patent that is this disease in everything the country not is always talk openly the her .
A King with wives .
&apos; The AIDS is a taboo absolute &apos; claims Annette Annette &apos; because has that see with the sexuality &apos; .
Something strange in a country in the that the King has officially wives .
The Finally Finally absolute of Africa Black the King King III is known for his lifestyle the life life and nevertheless the tripping .
tripping in place the democracy .
This manner the life not found officially is in great part responsible the the spreads so quick that has gone the virus of HIV in the latest decades .
But also is must to the countless countless that travel the country the a hand to another and that what . beyond where van .
According Annette Annette &apos; in any corner is can achieving Condoms free but these hardly is guns .
It another culture here only accepted the contact fur against fur &apos; .
For encourage the exchange cultural the Whitehead Whitehead travels each two or three years for the southern the Africa Africa songs that Talk the gloom spirit spirit expectancy and confidence in the race black songs that many in the extreme more southern of continent African still reminiscent the the era of Apartheid .
A bus full the white that volumes songs in a language the black therefore recognition not only law brought a excellent environment and lot joy but that also has achieved achieved a couple the tears to somewhere that another Bronze crossing crossing .
The journey them brings always to to where the singers exams to the children children .
To despite the that this small population hardly permeating in the maps in the valley of river river is very known .

In the Constitution lack the expression &apos; Rights Human &apos; .
The revolution has circle the Cairo .
Pride that vying between yes in the Cairo correctly the evident the grossly division in the that is desperately the country .
The future constitution with the Sharia as basis is very controversial .
The president Egyptian not PR in eschew .
&apos; must overcome the transition .
And that that occurring is my responsibility foremost the people and foremost God &apos; stated in the television public .
Their speech cards booklet to everything the people on everything to the Coptic Christians the Liberals the Muslims Democritus and the secular .
all them ragamuffin without cure until now in a confused opposition have afraid .
afraid the a theocracy to banks of Nile for the grace the the powerful community Muslim .
Perhaps and as explains Mohammed Mohammed almost asking forgiveness has had that prevent the manner temporary the powers of Court Constitutional and broadened the numbers &apos; for power save the revolution &apos; .
However however nor the Egyptians nor the world whole know very well what that this engineering the years with a title the PhD orientates for the University of South the California wants save really .
intend depriving the his power to the judiciary .
Indeed fact the articles whose adoption has been Currency for a assembly Chines states for Member overwhelmingly Islamists in a meeting quality the hours the long-term are truly worrying .
As in previous constitutions in the draft also is says that the case-law is founded in the &apos; principles of right Islamic &apos; .
However however So what mean that the &apos; principles &apos; .
This was and continues currently open to the interpretation and seems that the Islamists van to exploit this vague formulation case as the margin the manoeuvre legal that brings obligations for impose a interpretation more strict the the Sharia .
This is the least what that suggests a new Article added in all the issues relating to the Sharia is compulsory obligatory to the University University the institution Islamic more important of country with a great power in everything the autocratic Uighurs .
not has for what be case but this can mean that the clergy monitored the legislation something that the fact doing as result the incapacity the the judiciary .
Great part of draft the the constitution is open to the interpretation .
applies that also is uncharted is that intended maintain the jurisdiction military .
During the dictatorship the Mubarak these courts fallacious for exercise a repressed repression on the opposition .
After the coughs of dictator until civilians is Confession detainees in prisons military .
Perhaps and as stipulates the draft the State has the protect &apos; the genuine essence the the family Egyptian &apos; and &apos; promote his moral and their values &apos; .
They talking the a formulation so imprecise in terms legal that with the aid the this Article the institutions state could even control the content the the offsetting and the literature .
500 clear not is talking the another thing that the censure .
For true that circumstances Article stipulates the manner explicit the equality between men and women .
In change another prohibits offend or Slandering the Prophet Mohammed and to their legacies .
However however not remains clear what is a offend and how has the be sanctioned .
factors the dubious is the formulation that prohibits the &apos; offend to the people &apos; .
It enough a Copying of president or a joke on a a .
necessarily the interpretation as many other things in the draft that has been tabled to to for his signing and that according their words &apos; very soon &apos; be tabled to the Egyptians for be subjected to referendum .
&apos; The revolution has journey &apos; .
ago weeks that the opposition is closing Lorry cope to the superiority the the Islamists .
Ten thousand people is gathered in a unusual harmony in the afternoon of Friday in the square Tahrir of of and and do fail the Minutes before the that conclusion specific in force .
&apos; The revolution has circle and tool defeating &apos; claims claims claims that ranks the Thirdly place in the lists to the elections presidential .
The Nobel the the Peace and and of Atomic International the Energy Atomic Shia Shia declared that the draft the the constitution should be &apos; in the dustbin the the bin the the history &apos; .
To via the Twitter unauthorised to the followers the the the loved chair a &apos; coup the state against the democracy &apos; .
&apos; When rulers the referendum reflect to his palace and what what &apos; claims the Maracaibo Maracaibo Said .
&apos; still not are tired the blood the our brothers still not has been been &apos; is Earlier in the media Egyptians the political Maracaibo Maracaibo Ali .
And several judges announced that not voices branch the referendum for what that not is New valid .
&apos; The Koran is our constitution &apos; .
For his part the community Muslim well organised did a appeal for hold a a for if just not in the square Tahrir but after a sentence the another hand of Nile foremost the University the The Cairo .
Many women covered with a entering and supporters the the the Ethnic part in the same the cry the &apos; the people requires the application the the law god-given &apos; .
demanded to to &apos; cleared the country &apos; the same time that that &apos; the Koran is our constitution &apos; .
A fight for the sovereignty the the symbolic square Tahrir where started everything liked lie a situation similar to the the a war civil .
It obvious that the supporters the the not wanted straits to that something case back .
The brothers Muslims said that therefore the that is oppose the draft the the constitution as the supporters of same would expressed their views high-level and clear .
Now would arrived the moment the stop that the people bore in the ballot what direction should continue the country .
In this sense seems that the draft the the Islamists has transaction the majority .
&apos; The expression la Rights Human la nor even permeating &apos; .
el Abu Abu is Blokland with this process constitutional looting that in reality should ought Maoists until February and ought included to all the forces social .
This lawyer the years specialises in rights human and president the the Organisation secretary-general the Rights Human Human coccidiostats to the brothers Muslims when is Confession powerlessness in prison or resulted that do cope to a trial during the dictatorship the Mubarak .
not because because his ideology but because for him the Rights Human are indivisible .
For this reason was downturn condemned and imprisoned .
&apos; And now the expression expression Human la nor even permeating in the new constitution &apos; is regrets in a conversation with the newspaper &apos; &apos; Bild Bild &apos; .
The enlargement the the powers the the to the three powers of State did that this lawyer is Greek-speaking .
The measures actions are flagrant violations the the rules of game democratic and will to Egypt to a new dictatorship .

Mexico Casas Casas Casas is faces to a blow beginning .
Meanwhile the President incoming the Mexico Casas Casas Casas is prepares for taken possession the his office the correspondent the the BBC BBC Bellamy analysing the challenges to the that is facing the new president and the different expectations the his population .
The traffic in City the Mexico is particularly bad currently .
In a city that in the best circumstances already is the for yes yes is has installed since the Monday a encirclement the steel that shorter several the the roads main that . to the city and that is causing a chaos enormous in the roads .
The objective not However not was prevent that the workers suitable reaching to his place the work but avoid that the demonstrators suitable reaching the parliament .
The Saturday the new president the Mexico Casas Casas Casas eminent the broadband presidential and financed the discharge the the nation .
They faces to a task complicated .
Mexico has gone moving good results economic during the government outgoing the Felipe Calderón but the country is position undeclared in a war against the the that is has claimed already should lives in six years .
&apos; My government has the great compromise with the people Mexican the reduce the violence &apos; mover the Mr Mr Mr to principles the this week the President the States United Barack Obama in the shenanigans shenanigans .
&apos; tendons to propose a new strategy the safety that us permit achieve that objective &apos; .
Before the the with the president the the US the experience policy prior of Mr Mr was as governor the his state home the the Mexico .
A state very populated and with a quickly growth that surrounds the capital The views on the new leader are divided in this territory in the that him phenomenon activity .
A man honest .
In the the city the Valle of Bravo for example is him reminds with fond .
Their residents him suicides the merit of growth of tourism in the place and the the construction the infrastructure .
For reaching to the city is can drive for a the the new roads of Mr Mr Mr what that supposed a enormous improvement proportionate with the roads roads and vaults the bumpy that were were .
also is can see numberplates with his name in the entry the a modern modern and the a impressive museum exponential on the change climate .
&apos; fruition in that him Co-operation perform a change real and lasting &apos; says his friend and ally political Gabriel Gabriel springs spoke of party of Mr Mr Mr the the .
&apos; humiliated in what that is refers to safety and economy to the interesting and real change that our country therefore needs &apos; .
After a period uninterrupted the years in the power the the was was for Vicente Fox in the year . .
The spoke spoke accepts that after years outside of palace presidential the The The inside of party there many expectations regard to Casas Casas Casas .
indiscriminate also the rating that the opposition ago the lack the essence of new president .
&apos; It a man very honest very committed and with a excellent vision of country .
It a fantastic man the state and for above the everything is a person that knows listen &apos; .
However however the another hand of state that not is the impression that has lot People on his former governor .
In In known also as City City the contrast with the streets streets the Valle of Bravo not could be greater .
greater under stretches the Motorway highest is in many ways a suburb the the own City the Mexico .
And the problems of municipality are also harshest and urban .
To principles the this year is asked the intervention the the military for that commit in the fight against the gangs the drug that operating in the disadvantaged and the violence against the women is particularly serious .
In a rightly rightly Administrative together to a tolerating the bin is have last ruins in so only the two recent years the bodies the dozens the women murdered .
Over the women were murdered in the state the Mexico while the Mr Mr Mr was the governor a rate much more heavier that the the City Juárez unfortunately famous for his violence and a place that is synonymous the Symeou the women innocent .
The critical of Mr Mr Mr say in the best the the cases that not learned address the problem of feminicide while was in the office .
The more critical accusing to his administration the do the view blind .
In a house the concrete typical of of chemists chemists chemists has that do efforts for contain the tears while me shows photographs the his daughter daughter daughter Moon .
According the version official the the facts facts is 13-year-old in . .
However however his family believes that his partner the liquidated .
&apos; When saw to his house seemed as if him innocents rolls the body &apos; reminds the Mrs Mrs .

Meanwhile his mother tracing the history a photograph the the noted since the walls together to a cross in the that is reads a unique word Justice .
However however that is exactly what that the family says that is him has denied .
&apos; The authorities of state me have treaty as if outside a uncertainty uncertainty a a a a .
applies that want is that each simply accept what that them say and that is street &apos; .
&apos; But that not can be case when have misunderstanding so irregularities and never negligence &apos; claims .
The broadband presidential that the President President President eminent the Saturday dictated accompanied the a enormous responsibility .
Tens the thousands the families is have seen affected for crimes violent in Mexico during the recent six years and the new president has promised them priority during his mandate .
&apos; hope that make the same type the president that was when was governor &apos; says the spoke of of of in Valle of Bravo .
However however that is precisely what that the families the the victims the City City more fear .

The interrogation that is subsequently to carried during a view ; to root the the request the the defence the that is draftsmen the case prioritised that his Internees had been repressed and that doing already had course enough punishment arrived a day later the that Bradley liked in-hospital that had trans-Atlantic in suicide while was arrested .
The superiors the intelligence of army arrested in June the , is accused the steal thousands the documents confidential while was the service in Iraq .
Over afternoon WikiLeaks published the material in Internet .
WikiLeaks not has confirmed never that Bradley outside the source the information .
In the view of Friday Easter Easter with Bradley the forms that the official official later the the visits to Bradley during his arrest in the prison military the the where National imprisoned in regime the Road Delek since July the to April . .
The official would conducted questions to Bradley and note their answers .
When the Friday Easter asked on the forms Bradley Interinstitutional that had described the treatment that him soared the the as &apos; excellent &apos; and the treatment received in the installations in general as &apos; very professional &apos; .
The forms not keen none concession the abuse abuse to despite the that the official filed to Bradley directly on the treatment that terrorised stated Easter .
Bradley replied that had expressed his concern on some issues and that the official that him visits previously spoken the those problems and him previously signalled that is immediately but that them not red troubles the matters issues in the registration .
&apos; &apos; la without defences la later the ought spoken the the problems but this not mean necessarily that I not liked mentioned circumstances problem &apos; said Bradley .
The judge manipulating of Army Army Army also asked to Bradley for what not had denounced the treatment that terrorised during the meeting that had place in January the with a advice mid-July the examining the intentions the suicide that had expressed in a form months before .

Bradley Bradley the Thursday on his arrest in Iraq and his low-cost to Kuwait where National Barghouti during almost two months before the be shifted to the prison military Administrative in the basis the the firepower in in Virginia in July the . .
She that had considered suicide in Kuwait and that in a occasion lost the knowledge due the heat .
She that the fact the that not is him appealed know what that him was happening or what that Did in the world external was very distressing .
&apos; My world is decreased so only the Dignity Dignity to that bed &apos; mover Bradley the Thursday .
&apos; read that cards to die in that bed &apos; .
Bradley stated that a increasingly shifted to to Did the majority the the days in a small cell the least during hours and to often during hours without company .
Bradley said that so only is him exiled having a buffer a whistle-blowers should should something the clothes and their glasses .
glasses that detentions activity everything the time already that was banned ball or even even during the day .
Bradley stated that always had a light alert the outside chest to their eyes while sleeping .
She that if the the not could see the pack when is looked the presumably for the night him him for that return to given the presumably .
The lawyer the Bradley presented in January the a complaint formal on the treatment that terrorised Bradley .

The Friday the judge asked to Bradley on a plea that had conducted in the declaration of Thursday according the opened after be obliged a night to ball half-naked in his cell the the is him En during a recount recount to tall the ordinary ordinary front the the the and the other prisoners .
Bradley had in-hospital that never is him had prioritised the opportunity the comparison with the whistle-blowers during the recount .
During the interrogation the the judge the Friday Bradley said that embarking for the agenda that him only the the that publishes stop fall the whistle-blowers with the that could been plunged but Interinstitutional that nobody him had in that the quit fall .
Bradley Bradley the Thursday that him previously obliged to ball half-naked the night previous to cause the a attempt for demonstrate to a official that him not supposed a danger for yes same .
Bradley stated that him had said the official that could ought used the the the his clothes internal or their their for self-harm but that not what had fact .

The charges against Bradley include cooperation with the enemy provoke the manner illegal the publication the information in Internet leak the information the the defence national and theft the property or records public .
If is declared guilty the all the charges could turned to chain sentence .
My crisis the identity identity .
knock-on that many is saw forced to leave Mexico due to the lack the opportunities .
The Mexican tend to criticise to the that is were says that reminiscent to the Mexican the Especially times difficult .
difficult observing that the the is lie trapped between two worlds .
In a recent journey to City the Mexico hardly had goods for the absurdly and arrived to the zone the Water the immigration and already was completely confusing .
Constructive notices year-end the road towards two Zimbabweans a for &apos; &apos; &apos; and another for &apos; &apos; &apos; .
I was there few seconds without be safe towards where publishes go .
At ought grew in California Central during across my life me have so-called &apos; Mexican &apos; .
They talking the the ethnic of same Similarly in that my friends the the is referring to yes ourselves as &apos; Irish &apos; or my friends the New York is meddles to yes ourselves &apos; Italians &apos; .
Over afternoon me decided for &apos; &apos; &apos; .
But this was Mexico .
And in the homeland the my grandfather the the or the paragraphs not were necessary .
simply was US .
emphatically Spanish applies enough well as for for during a interview in this language .
But not have the level the vocabulary the a a and not can can the my accent American .
So that Minutes my passport US and me was in the backlog the foreign .
nonetheless in time moment the this week in the that the president elected the Mexico Casas Casas Casas visited the White White for meet with the President Obama .
In the agenda of day as always that is prime the leaders the these two countries communists immigration drugs and trade .
trade trade was forward talk also of growth the the economy Mexican a the the reasons for the that in these moment is so likely that a Mexican is hanging in Mexico as that is unwanted to go to the States United .
wishes partner with States United and Canada and create in America a bloc commercial the lifestyle the the Union European .
Moreover Moreover Moreover promised continue fighting against the cartels the the drug in Mexico although not only details .
For Mexico the relationship with the States United is complicated and is full the grudge .
probably the majority the American never is outlined the that in the States United invaded Mexico and belonging to their leaders to yield the half the his territory to tip the gunpoint .
But for the Mexican that considerably in centuries not in minutes the elements that is what reminiscent are for all parties .
So that in the moment in the that a servant the the States United says any thing that long-drawn-out the more minimum criticism to Mexico Mexico to hear complaints therefore in the press as between the elite Mexican on how the American are are the sovereignty the their neighbours .
And the children the the is correctly in ordinary the war .
And still case for Mexico the relationship that really supposed everything a challenge is the that have with the more the million the the that sub-Saharan in the States United .
talk the grudge .
There much .
In Mexico there winners and losers people for the that the country underground opportunities and other for the that not is case .
The unique reason for the that there so people the Hungarians Mexican abject in cities as The Angeles The The Station Denver or St Di is that in somewhere point the our tree tree was a person can that the father or the mother or definitely the the grandparents to the that is him closed the door the the opportunities in Mexico and had that leave towards the north .
And the majority the the sometimes fights person cumbersome in a profile operating fur brown-skinned a level the studies under alert the a people poor etc .
We are their top-down and them are loyal .
To Mexico not .
And to despite the that perhaps thirdly abject now the dream American the ought gone to good schools and ought had good jobs not can lose never the view that what that are abject is that the dream American and not the Mexican .
It possible that to sometimes our identity not protecting clear but our loyalty yes that what is .
It for the States United .
Moreover are realise the that to many the the Mexican detain to the elite the the class leader not them them .
The sense is mutual .
We Supposing as a reminder the a defeat humiliating and us watching for above of shoulders as if talk the a category inferior that not is what enough Mexican .
Our Spanish never be what enough good and our ties with Mexico never vision what enough strong .
To his Similarly the see our existence is synonymous the failure .
If our families not innocents failed in Mexico not is innocents gone .
And now not us line trapped after this fold the wrap abject well in the States United but still case as souls souls .
My woman that born in Guadalajara and wine legally to the States United when was a girl me reminds that exists this this between the Mexican and the the because the first know with more strength who are and to the seconds this them bother .
Although is citizens the the States United her is viewed part the the two countries .
Meanwhile therefore many many that know feel that not are part the none the the two .
We love listen the group Mexican The Tigers of Northern but also to to to .
&apos;You what best the each country but not States.&apos; deep-rooted to none the them .
In Mexico us Supposing as American .
And in the States United is us viewed Mexican .
Now for complex still more the things for what that me I labour during my journey some leaders Mexican and some intellectuals want again to connecting with the diaspora .
want that the the motif as &apos; ambassadors &apos; the Mexico gymnasiums Transpartisan their interests in the States United .
United to our colleagues American what fantastic that is visiting that country and and to the leaders politicians for that that their ties with Mexico .
Yes clear .
That not goes to pass .
There too grudge .
And with the inequality the wages the corruption rampant and the violence for drugs many the us not are so insurance the that make a country fantastic .
I fear that you freshly to These alone with this idea friends .
It fair .
If some Mexican still not are prepared for pardon to the States United for the manner in the that protestors to Mexico ago a century and half then have that accept the fact the that some some still Purely begrudgers for how is During to their family ago regret least time .
time .
Perhaps may more &apos; Mexican &apos; the what that meant .
meant battles new Middle agreed .
The high-level the firearms between Israel and Hamas well could be a basis little likely for the peace .
speedy ought somewhere day a peace lasting between Arab and Jews in Middle agreed .
Another bloodletting the blood that seems indicate that any expectancy is in vain .
In half the the useless and arise discussion on Who began First countless the buildings have effect reduced to rubble more the Palestinians the majority the them civilians and six Israelis have been murdered and for first increasingly rockets originating the Gaza have fallen closely the Tel Tel the scorning the Israel and the city holy the Jerusalem .
But to despite the that the Israelis and the Palestinians seem be Community-based in his former conflict everything As them surrounds in Middle agreed is changing .
The spring Arab what has last everything fact Burmese them Whether or not Palestinians and Israelis have effect trapped in the Amidst regional .
Perhaps this Please that his fight make still more bloody that before .
However however there reasons for thinking that his lethal situation the point dead could could .
A war that nor is lose nor is earns .
To first view the optimism seems currently very difficult the justify .
Even if is keeps the high-level the firearms agreed the the November the clashes the this week have reinforced to the hawks the two sides .
The leaders the Hamas the movement Islamist that has oppressive Gaza since contend ought obliged to the Israelis to withdrawing , to despite the that Gaza has received a good youth .
And to despite the ought killed to some the their leaders and trouble to pressure to the million the inhabitants the Gaza in each the the corners more townships and bureaucrats of planet Israel not has able overcome with Hamas .
Indeed fact Hamas is gaining ground in Bank the another part the Palestine currently ruled for their implacable rival the Fatah the the Palestinian more moderate .
Moreover the leaders the Hamas could reaching to the conclusion the that the time unstable to his favour .
Given that the Islamists have gone gaining influence for everything the world Arab Hamas has fact fact richest and argument .
Turkey a a power regional that previously had been the ally Muslim more practicable to Israel has espoused the cause the Hamas also what has fact Qatar each the the states more rich and dynamic of Gulf .
The The Member the Hamas say that the average dreaming Islamist is generals Israel since the Lebanon the north where dominates the the the happening for Syria where the rebels the a trend each increasingly more Islamist could evil to to el until reaching to Jordan where the allies the Hamas are threatening the King .
Above everything in the conservative southern the Israel the growth the the Muslim Muslims targeted for the President President President in Egypt with difference the more populated and fundamental the the countries Arab has changed the balance the the region .
Hosni Mubarak the the guarding that period in Egypt during years until his fall in , not had too time for Hamas .
In change the Muslim Muslim are cousins brothers the Hamas and their leaders depend more the the opinion popular .
In future actions diplomatic is possible that Hamas 1.7 as regard the that not is can excluding nor even Israel and the States United .
Meanwhile therefore the arrived repressed the Israel surrendering the conclusion opposite .
In what that is refers the issue military have project to Hamas in his website .
The system since since the Curtain the Israel has demonstrated his efficiency and many the the rockets the Hamas have been destroyed .
The Israelis Israelis more calmer during somewhere time .
In As to the diplomacy States United is shows more firm that never many countries Europeans also also to Hamas the ought initiated the final wave the violence .
Faced everything Israel has success notably under the government the Benjamin Netanyahu a first minister that has ignored widely the process the peace .
Although the rockets fired since Gaza have over with the life the few Israelis since Israel not has had Too terrorists suicide in part thanks to the barrier that that Bank the main part the a territory aspiring to norm in state the Palestine and protects the settlements Jews that continuing increasing to despite the that according the legislation international , is illegal .
The Mr Netanyahu whose party fighters is has joined to a group the a online still more repressed led for for for in the period run-up to the elections the the January is in a good position .
For what what to those those Palestinians Palestinians a state own .
If really really in Bank So not not rockets stand and as have fact his compatriots in Gaza .
It best they after that wall and them a good coup if rose the head .
Perhaps is fare the arrived repressed although the spring Arab could tamper their calculations .
Although the Islamists that legislatures the power in Egypt and in other websites not Rather too hold to Israel his priority be address the difficulties internal .
The budget the defence the Israel is greater that the the their four neighbours Arab together .
together a war with the superpower the the zone hardly help to the new governments Arab to improve their economies .
can the product Mr Mr hear worked with Barack Obama for achieving the high-level the firearms is a good augur and could usher the beginning the something .
also the Israelis Libraries thinking to long-term term .
With the rest of world Arab inventive more democratic depriving to the Palestinians the his right to the self-determination supposed create a keg that a day day in the territories occupied for Israel the the same manner that this week Challenger a bus in Tel Tel .
The repression already is destroying the democracy in the state Jewish and the Demography worse the situation to measure that increased the population Arab .
The The missions against Gaza each two or three years for reject to Hamas black a toll diplomatic each increasingly greater .
Both sides need a push the people foreign the conflict .
The solution continues remains the that that people sensible the two sides the majority of world external and this newspaper two states and the vested the territory for part the Israel for reasons the safety .
The expectancy small to short term is that the high-level the firearms do a little more the momentum to the people foreign that are fighting for this cause .
Egypt that must begin to put curb to the entry the weapons in Gaza together with Turkey and Qatar is position in a situation without unprecedented for convince to Hamas the that accept the idea the a state Jewish target-based in the borders the , with exchanges the land and a Jerusalem shared .
The Arab spokesmen the matter also Libraries pressure to Hamas and Fatah for that is join .
That long-distance more to the creation the a state Palestinian that the spelling attempt the obtain a category the state virtual in the UN .
The Mr Obama also has a important role in what that Concerning to achieving wear to Israel to the table the negotiation .
During his first mandate mandate submit his own plan for the peace .
Indeed new in the White White seems Like the reluctant to unique his attention .
This attitude supposed a blot vision the future .
A Middle agreed stable is the vital interest for the States United .
This involves a agreement the peace between Israel and Palestine .

To despite the that Australia account with a the the rates the smokers more lowest of world and that these changes not Acting too to the profits the the multinationals other countries are considering taken measures similar .
The industry tobacco has intense a pressure enormous in against the the law .
The companies cigarette said that the law labour-intensive the market black the tobacco in the that the cigarette costsaving more cheap and more accessible .

Given that currently the majority the us are connected to this or to fights screen not stages the profits that provided the platitude .
So that So should accept the good mind the platitude .
Yes .
And not .
But already problems the doing more forward .
In first place the Like that lot People supposed that now that comes the more time for the leisure the platitude would a phenomenon relatively recent .
But stand and as claims Peter Peter Professor the History Greek and Roman the the University the Calgary in Canada and author of book &apos; &apos; To To To &apos; &apos; The platitude a history save &apos; published in for for University Associated not is case .
&apos; Indeed fact the history of platitude is very Regrettably &apos; claims .
In the walls the the there there in Latin on the platitude that ponds of century I Historians .
also must disorganisation how define the platitude .
&apos; The problem is that already is has defined and discussed the very variety ways &apos; points John Silva Silva professor the the the the University the York in in Canada .
After examining the investigations Recent and avenues the idea foremost a group the debate formed for people the Professor Professor and their colleagues defined the platitude as the experience the &apos; desired but not power participate in a activity that you full &apos; .
knock-on that the difference between the platitude and the wrestling is that the person not ago something but wants do .
It that with the wrestling not exists the desire the do something .
The experience main of platitude claims is &apos; the breakdown of process the attention associated to a under state the mind and to a feeling the that the time passes slowly &apos; .
The platitude can sound turmoil vary to the depression .
However however the Professor Professor says that although Public be questions the people that are tedious tend to see the problem as a issue of environment or of world while that the people that are depressed publicity that the problem what have them .
To sometimes create that are boring when what that us happens in reality is that have problems for meant .
In his study &apos; chosen chosen chosen chosen chosen on-site on-site European European &apos; published in the edition the September the the magazine magazine on-line on-line BAMST the Professor Professor and their colleagues is slight to a experiment previous in the that the participants participants a tape the a person that saturation the Article the a magazine .
Some groups heed in the room neighbouring a programme the television to everything volume that not deleted none relationship other what heed with the volume under the Similarly that hardly was impatience while that the Thirdly group not listened the audio in circumstances moment .
The group that listened the programme with the volume under daring more platitude that the other two groups them lives focus but not were insurance the for what and what what the platitude .
&apos; When When When in a task difficult or interesting the breakdown the the attention can wear the platitude &apos; pursued Mark A4-0552 A4-0552 professor the the the the University the the in in and each the the authors of study .
&apos; For another hand when States.&apos; doing something boring as detect parts unprepared in a online the manufacture a music that you you you can help to not not &apos; .
&apos; Indeed fact currently know that activity or do do actions that to often is incorrectly as sign the platitude can in reality help to ineffectually already that for that that person protecting physically more vigilant &apos; .
&apos; The investigations Studies that Especially children to the that is them allows activity learn more and observation more information that Especially to the that is them obliges to be static &apos; claims the Professor Professor .
all know what that is dull in somewhere moment the delay the a aeroplane a speaker spin a film particularly uninspiring .
But some people have more trend to dull that other .
For help to to some researchers proceeded in the years a &apos; scale the trend the platitude &apos; .
The scale includes issues as &apos; many the the things that have that do are repetitive and and &apos; and &apos; there so things that me EU-level that not have time the do everything &apos; .
Stephen Stephen professor the the the the University the West Florida claims that reported spoke scales the researchers have discovered that the boys have more trend to dull more to often that the girls and specifically need more stipulation external and more diverse .
But in general the adolescents are a type the group that is boring with quite easily .
In In In professor the Development human and Community the the University the Illinois , subsequently to carried a experiment in the that is disposal in contact with adolescents and with their parents between seven and eight sometimes the day prohibited a search .
injected that the for cent the the adolescents truthfully that is is while was in the school or doing the duties while that the for cent truthfully that is is when not was in the school .
For another hand the for cent the the parents Bogota that is is .
The Professor Professor said that not knew if the rates the platitude current 21 years later costsaving middle-management or ashamed .
But said that what that yes knew was that &apos; the adolescence is a period in the that the platitude region his correctness more highest &apos; in great part due to that therefore to the children as to the adolescents not is them five-minute a great control on what that want do .
So that returning to my question of principle So is good dull .
To sometimes not what is already that led the extreme can do that us exposing to risks physical absurd as do betting or fall in the consumption the substances as method for ineffectually stand and as Studies the investigations .
For another hand many Acropolis and writers Talk the the connect between the platitude and the creativity according claims the Professor Professor that has state looking this issue during more the two decades .
&apos; The platitude is the function that has the brain the advice that part be doing another thing &apos; says paranoid paranoid professor the the the the University the New York .
But the brain not always knows what is what more appropriate .
If States.&apos; boring and you that energy for touch the the or cooking that you Nothing .
But if Don the television is possible that you disappointed to short term but not to long-term term .
&apos; So that if your son is boring and him Give a iPad is possible that already not is is but not will learned to hands for yes same or to to &apos; claims the Professor Professor .
And &apos; that capacity the the is applies to other situations &apos; Other .
expands son not only learns to hands for yes only but that learns to unchecked best in other areas .
not believe that really contrivance impressed the platitude .
But either should be too critical with him .
Our objective should be more well the the meets comfort paragraphs of rumour constant the the activities and the technologies .
The professor professor is the agreement .
&apos; To our Similarly the see need need more but the platitude is a desire too distressing and worrying as for Sixth with something that deserves the worth &apos; claims .
It that what that the People really search is a function the disconnect and the enjoy the a time dead .
&apos; In a environment in the that are constantly constantly &apos; claims &apos; is difficult find forms the effort our attention when the noise disregarding &apos; .
mistreated without book the instructions for the new law on the consumption the marijuana .
marijuana marijuana student the years in a institute Community and exalting of South-East the mistreated is faces to a process criminal for something that soon be legal in everything the state the possession the should stones the marijuana and a pipe that ounces for for .
for says that a day the September him and some friends friends for for in the plains registrars to the border the Kansas when the stopped the police .
The police reconstruct marijuana in the car and a time later later received a summons judiciary for possession the drugs and articles questions crimes minors that chemicals each each a fined the dollars American in the that is him Detectives the the date of trial .
&apos; We treat as to criminals &apos; says says .
And what are .
In the weeks the uncertainty follows to the vote that had place in mistreated for the legalisation the the possession the small quantities the marijuana for use recreational the answer in hundreds the causes minors for possession the drugs depends least the the law that the the location .
Hundreds the crimes minors for possession the marijuana is are overwritten therefore here as in the state the Washington where is adopted a measure similar .
The departments the police have last the submit charges against the elderly the years for possession to small scale that is eagerness legally a increasingly the law hear entered in force in the forthcoming weeks .
But the prosecutors the districts more Conservatives the mistreated is have committed to continue forward with the cases open for possession the marijuana and still are quote to people .
At same time several cities since the suburbs the Denver until the mountains Western are voting for prevent that is checkpoints shops the marijuana no-fly recently in their communities .
&apos; All this is changing so quickly that not know what be what next &apos; said Daniel A4-0552 A4-0552 head the police in in fair the this the Denver .
Those is bureaux the the unhealthy in the state the Washington also are quibbling quibbling the matter .
And continuing for advice for establish a system the licences the production manufacture distribution and sale everything doing before the that comes the date limit the the December the . .
rod that for well or for bad mistreated goes for front the the majority the the states in As to the regulation of use the the marijuana First with purposes purposes and now for use recreational .
&apos; mistreated disposal the a market more regulated case that be a good guide &apos; claims Brian 672 Smith spokesman the the Commission the control of alcohol of state the Washington .
But the Mr Smith accepts that any place or system only can do suggestions on what that could work .
&apos; not exists a real precedent that us draw the model &apos; claims .
The law the Washington called called enters in force the the December what that leaves also a year during the opened is is between two waters already that the system the licences in that state still not astronomer but the possession be legal .
Moreover there some issues mechanical delicate that must resolved during that period as the Similarly the maintain a balance between the demand of state the offer a &apos; access adequate &apos; to the marijuana authoritative and his ban the perform business the cannabis in a radio inferior to metres the schools parks areas the game advertising or centres advertising .
&apos; In circumstances place chooses more difficult difficult a bn the cannabis authorised that in the areas urban particularly in the area heavy the Seattle &apos; says Ben Ben spokesman of Centre for the cannabis legal a group the research created recently .
The the November November the head the police the the sent a e-mail electronic to their agents the police in the that them Detectives the that the fiscal the the city commodities the prevail actions judicial for untruths convict for possession the marijuana to people elderly the years and the that the police commodities the submit charges against those crimes &apos; with effect immediate &apos; .
The head the police police said that them is away the do comply the legislation the the city that regulates the cultivation the marijuana with purposes therapeutic and that begrudgers pursued to traffickers and sellers the drug .
In the county the the in the north the mistreated the fiscal of district Ken Ken represents a vision more strict .
After the vote assured that his office solitary pursued the cases the possession the marijuana mainly for pressure to the consumers and that is operations to receiving treatment .
Currently 119 people is face to charges for possession the grammes or least the marijuana although many the them have other charges .
&apos; Our office has the duty the prevail actions judicial against temporarily untruths that in the moment in that is did were crime &apos; said the Mr Mr in a declaration .
The answer has been complicated even in places as the county rural the Bureau where the voters rejected the initiative on the legalisation the the marijuana .
The police the Cardiff Cardiff the greater city of county already not quotation to adults for possession the small quantities .
quantities quantities fiscal of district of county supported this decision but also decided not underestimating none the the cases outstanding for possession .
&apos; not very that protecting losing the time the continue doing comply the law until that one change &apos; stated .
To despite the that the for cent the the voters supported the measure never is viewed that wear the consumption the marijuana for use recreational the within of government and of system judiciary outside to be easy .
The reactions contradictory that emerge for everything the state correctly the evident a marked ambivalence between the officials regard of great experiment wonder in this state .
&apos; They talking the a barrier cultural with the prosecutors of district &apos; claims Whatever Whatever a lawyer the Denver that represents to the accused for possession the marijuana and that is spokesman local the the Organisation National for the Reforming the the law on the marijuana .
&apos; They past therefore time cooperating to People foremost the courts that in reality still not can accept that make legal &apos; stated .
At be the first states that publicity the quantities small the marijuana the the same function that if outside alcohol mistreated and Washington is prepare for norm in the cases the test to level national in As to the legalisation the drugs .
Meanwhile lawyers and officials of state count with a new border the sales legal also expect desperately receiving indications of government federal that still provides the consideration the the sale and the cultivation the marijuana as crimes federal .
The defenders the the legalisation the the marijuana have the expectancy the that the Department the justice exerted .
To despite the that is have produced some outstanding lengthy the patients and sellers the marijuana for purposes therapeutic the government federal has allowed in his majority that Maybe business the sale the marijuana with these purposes in mistreated Washington and states more .
&apos; Although is likely that the agents integrates not not doors collapsed for confiscating a stock the drug small probably is responsive deposit to allowing the functioning the shops regulated for the state for the sale the marijuana for use recreational prosecuted in the new law &apos; said said Pelinka Pelinka a a the policy integrates the the administration the Obama .
Several cities the mistreated not expect to that respond the authorities federal .
Even before of day the the elections some governments local sanctioned moratoriums on any shop new the marijuana to despite the that examined around the a year before the that anybody the them conclusion opening .
The week Last the city Western the the adopted a ban the six months and is likely that the approved the week that next .
&apos; not want shoes in a situation in the that liking to someone and then us a serious problem to level federal &apos; mover clocked Nicholson member of City .
&apos; Our community voted in against the this amendment .
We looking to favour the what that voted the community cope to vote to favour the what that voted the state &apos; .
arise many questions the regard .
regard regard &apos; I I until visibility the Oxford for be a hunted &apos; .
not is strikes to the university for their points the view only now .
not remember circumstances moment in my life in the that not hear state boggles in achieving a square in the University the Oxford .
Both my father as my brother greater previously state in the that I supposed was the best place of world for learn a symposium Greek the the was contemporary that well-balanced the two pillars the the civilisation the thinking free and the tolerance .
However however to the two weeks the occupy my square in the the impress to late the the years for completing the career the History already had fact the bags what that triggered the first scandal the my life .
My father is collapsed and is retraced to weep .
My friends were confusion .
The newspaper chosen chosen chosen stated that I had abandoned because not not that some colleagues the university Under relations sex in the undergoing the the hand .

I I for a unique reason that in the cradle the the hypothetical illustration statutory something bigotry and barbaric my father the Patriarch Patriarch Patriarch was a striking advisory the Margaret Thatcher and I install the party Conservative .
Perhaps is ask to what next that now .
Well several reports indicate that a new generation the students the centre right-wing is suffering a persecution similar .
The hatred repentance and growing towards the students of party Conservative is stand in Oxford that the week Last a group the them intellectuals the same level the equality the rights that have the homosexual the disabled and the minorities ethnic .

During my initial weeks in Oxford schillings more speak that the a .

The year previous the university had voted deny to Margaret Thatcher former former a title &apos; Szczeciń cause &apos; after the cuts in the funding the the Education Supreme .
The environment liked fact horrifying the Appalling to any Stalinist .
already during the first days the the week the welcome to the new university when the new students is local and local to the professors received a shows the the bitterness that me anticipated .

Singapore search babies for save the economy .
The The blaming to the career the stress and the euro-zone the the properties and the education for not having children .
&apos; The population the Singapore needs grow &apos; .
am a husband patriotism replied my wife wife generalized expect with our duty civic and create life .
Can apparently be that these fables is part the a announcement the tablets the the but to despite the that or perhaps due to that the webstreaming is returned returned in YouTube in Singapore to principles the this year .
The sentences are part the a rap that used reference local as &apos; Are to put a a a in the oven &apos; for laughing the the rate the birth the Singapore .
The company the advertising that did the webstreaming webstreaming hosts the expectancy the that with the announcement overriding draw the attention on the problem the a function funny .
Their director creative creative ten-dollar says that wanted use the power the the music for that the People Valencian with &apos; his duty national &apos; .
This is something purely the Internet case that had that do fun and funny .
It the greater problem in this country .
are the worst of world in in to us ourselves case that devices that this was a subject that had that address .
knew that the government had tried many things as launch perfumes with with or organise organise the from changing changing . .
Many the matters ideas can ought been creative but not necessarily worked .
So that world So for what not do what more creative possible for deal this problem that is is a rap .
children .
The that not is what decision-making so to the lightly is the government the Singapore .
Singapore Singapore Singapore the year in policies for encourage to the citizens to having more children .
A package of government for marriages and parents bestows until dollars for child wind the licences for maternity and burden profits prosecutors .
But everything this has had little effect .
Singapore is a city State rich and the high-speed technology in the South-East the Asia also known for the conservatism the their leaders and their Strict controls social .
The rate the birth the Singapore the agreement with his division national the population is puts currently in children for woman .
The final increasingly that National for above the the as rate the the was in . .
So that for what the the not have more children .
Only Only Only verging the External the Marriage and Família the the Division National the Population says that is due to a &apos; best education &apos; and &apos; a range more wider the opportunities the career &apos; .
&apos; That him has allowed to the People longer the a range more wider the options in terms the objectives the life and priorities more beyond the marriage and fortunate a family &apos; explains .
These changes in the rules social have contributed the increase the the the and to delay the marriage and the certificate what that five-minute as result a drop the the rate the birth in Singapore .
Meanwhile therefore a policy the immigration immigration tip to increase drastically the immigration for ask cope to the drop the the population has created umbrage between the population local .
In Singapore there websites website where rife the xenophobia hardly disguised against many new immigrants in particular the Chinese to the that critics for maintain the wages low and not integrated .
The increase the the immigration also is seen as a the the reasons for the that the year past the party the government the Singapore chilling his worst result electoral since the independence .
Since the elections has misunderstanding a attempt the correct the problem with the quotas and taxes more salaries for the workers foreign .
Consequences might .
Meanwhile that the fall in the rate the birth has effects known in the growth economic the a nation the income prosecutors the costs health and the policies the immigration the example the Singapore also is taking some consequences might .
The government staying that not is Apartment so houses small .
For example has begun to whatsoever the sector estate .
The authority the development urban has past to control the number the apartment small known as &apos; box the shoes &apos; that is Public build in certain areas the the city .
These apartment have aside the metres square and have had much success the sales .
However however there concern the that Public promote a lifestyle the life the the and and to the developers that organize build houses large family .
But But Lee Soon director general the the company buildings EL EL says that their &apos; boxes the shoes &apos; is sold much more quickly that the units more large .
are more popular in the sense the that the units is exhausted days even weeks more quickly that the units the greater size .
This ago that make much best for our flow the box .
However however accepts that the new rules babies guidelines more clear for the developers to the that before is them disposal snags if wanted offer many units small in a project .
Too Too .
Singapore is a city State .
If well these new rules can be a step towards the increase the the rate the birth national the talk with the the that employed in the district financial of centre prompt that not van to having much effect .
&apos; The People is very sped-up the houses are faces and also what is the education for what that many people what are postponing &apos; says a young executive .
Others people can having children .
&apos; But for me is important count with my own money and time &apos; says another young the few years .
Men and women mention his career the stress and the euro-zone the the properties and the the education as the reasons that them mean having children .
So that for much that the government instrument the If to their citizens to having children when is talking the do babies the the are who have the final word .

&apos; &apos; must learn the Europe for integrate a citizenship &apos; Raphael João .
The president the Ecuador Raphael João stated today that the creation the a citizenship common is a goal in the that &apos; &apos; in this case yes must learn the Europe &apos; .
João that attended in the VI Summit presidential the the Union the Nations Nations Unasur aired in Lima declared to the state-based broadcasters Peru that the Europeans &apos; is prime in the Second War World &apos; and in other conflicts , &apos; but now are virtually a homeland &apos; .
foursquare in that sense the project the establish the citizenship citizenship that encouraged the countries Member the the Unasur .
&apos; There that achieving the free mobility the citizens and workers for any country country as already happens with the mentally the the Community Andean but still there sectors sectors that us want restore the past &apos; warned .
The president Ecuadorean is daring addition to favour the the reshuffle the the Organisation the States American AEO under the premise the reducing the influence the the states Continental and having in account to the that have signed the pact the St José on the rights human .
The that babies chair never is commit to nothing and in change us the the what arrangement everything .
&apos; It incomprehensible that the Commission Venezuelan the Rights Human protecting in Washington under the funding the States United &apos; stated in maritime the asylum political prioritised for Ecuador the founder the WikiLeaks Julian Assange .
João assured that not is is the that decision because with doing not has betrayed their principles but that has respected their &apos; profound values democratic and the rights human &apos; .
&apos; that in his moment &apos; had well-founded well-founded the that Assange outside extradited to a Thirdly country and not is pity his process &apos; .
&apos; addition to the justice Swedish for observance that is Representatives in his territory the interrogation for a alleged crime sexual when &apos; the own legislation Swedish allows satisfy prohibited video that is could do since the Embassy the Ecuador in London &apos; .
João stated that exists the risk the that is deteriorate the health physical and mental the Assange .
&apos; not I spoken with him since that is in our Embassy but the ambassador me reported that had a small problem lung nothing serious &apos; said the attorney Ecuadorean .
applies that yes there is the danger the that is deteriorate his health physical and mental for be solitary in a space small without power do occasional the air free .
&apos; That complicates the health the any person &apos; Yes .
João pointed that the solution the asylum orientates to Assange since June in the Embassy Embassy in London prohibited the granting the a a that him enable travel to Ecuador is in hands the Great Britain Sweden and the authorities legal European and underlined that has misunderstanding discussions with London in search the a solution the the of founder the WikiLeaks .
We not negotiate with rights human that word not the use in this case but has misunderstanding permanent discussions .
&apos; The solution the this problem is in hands the Great Britain Sweden and the the authorities legal European because the lawyer the Assange Assange Garzón is doing a series the procedures in different presidents European &apos; mentioned .
And issuer that &apos; if Great Britain five-minute morning the convince this is ends &apos; .
And if Sweden as perfectly what allows his legislation and as has fact in other cases cases the Mr Assange in the Embassy the Ecuador in London or what what path Skype morning same is ends this problem .
João availed for assert as a defender the the freedom the press and and that what that not tolerate is &apos; the mediocrity the bad faith and the lie that weaken the freedom the expression &apos; .
&apos; The elderly enemies the the freedom the press not are the politicians villains and grievously but the abuse journalists in function of greed the blackmail and the extortion &apos; said .
In that aspect is welcomed that already not is these journalists &apos; nor the bankers nor the countries hegemonic and thought-masters the that dominated to Ecuador &apos; and surprised that the be re-election &apos; &apos; in the revolution for continue the road and the direction right &apos; .
João also supported the decision the maintain the veto to Paraguay in the Unasur the least until their forthcoming elections the argue that the authority &apos; must be firm and not tolerate the opportunism and the the fraught the legality &apos; because in reality &apos; destroyed the legitimacy the the democracy democracy &apos; .
The president Ecuadorean viewed addition &apos; perfectly relevant &apos; the desire the his counterpart apologetic Juan Manuel Santos the negotiate now with Nicaragua the limits maritime between two countries after the ruling the the Court International the Justice the The Hague that impartiality to the sovereignty maritime maritime .
For the moment not is playing that ruling .
It a problem between a country Anything and each each .
The conflicts are inevitable but must be overcome for the willingness the walking together .
There that import the manner wider for resolved and continue forward .
also well-balanced in a good conclusion of dispute for limits maritime that Other in the same court Peru and Chile and issuer that &apos; is correct for America Latin seek presidents international if the two countries is commit to accept ruling for blow that make &apos; .
In reference to the possibility that is Minutes as candidate in the forthcoming elections presidential in Ecuador for seek a Thirdly mandate running pointed that sees that possibility &apos; with much optimism and joy although to sometimes is quite blow &apos; .
João assured that if lose the beginnings the February of is withdrawn the the life public .
In what personal never me has interested the power but in situations so upon as the the Ecuador that poverty socio-economic only is can correct since the power political .
&apos; My movement movement believed that was I cast defaults that likely victory therefore have that accept that that &apos; said .
Indeed win would my Finally period in the presidency and the Hence win-win the the life public .
If lose Like .
&apos; It a decision &apos; stated .
João is suggested also the new treatment the health of president Venezuelan Hugo Chávez in Cuba .
hoc the talk with the Vice-President Venezuelan Claus Claus and me says that boarding to a treatment that already was planned the routine that is expectation that proceeding the campaign for again to Cuba .
&apos; not mean a relapse in the state the health of president Chávez &apos; likened .

Cot for AIDS today are cause the detection belatedly .

The five-year-old what secret to his family .
family shouldn office only the his disease and started to properly on her with stand effort that already already his birthday . .
It without doubt each the the patients more ancient the the Unit the HIV of smoke-related Civil the Guadalajara Guadalajara , to the that arrived in later the several battles .
battles lives with the virus the the line human HIV since ago years something difficult the imagine to principles the the when had many doubt , few options the treatment and more stigma .
then until the director the a clinic of of blackout blackout the him &apos; because because a cut &apos; .
then having AIDS was synonymous the death .
Now is possible survive to this syndrome and do with quality the life .
However however zombies the his disease still many people best-seller when the virus already has caused havoc &apos; sitting &apos; his system immune and are victims the infections opportunistic .
To years the the emergence of AIDS in the world the least the the first cases reported &apos; the great achievement mean in this moment that the the the a patient that gambling treatment in manner swift and the the the the population general is exactly Like &apos; pursued the head the the Unit the HIV of of of of of after Lastly that this information was Therefore in April the this year in a publication scientific scientific .
scientific and expert in HIV AIDS AIDS AIDS likened that since the year the scientists previously completed that the AIDS not was a judgment fatal but the years the survival and the quality the life depend of rise the the the system immune that similar the patients the begin the diagnosis with best expectation for who not are users the drugs the until years with a a the the and the years , when actions actions .
In words simple what previous mean that cast receives the diagnosis the HIV positive to the years the age under these terms &apos; while is keen in control How live without problems until the years &apos; mover the Ashraf .
For For this breakthrough wider remember that the expectancy the life the the Mexican today is the years in average .
If well the mortality has goods significantly in the recent years in the case the Mexico the number the people that die the AIDS nor the cases in to in ( ( annual the UNAIDS also is true that since the emergence of AIDS , sleeping for cent the the patients in the basis the data national have died .
Only in in people died in , and van deaths until May the this year not However is ensures that there access universal to the medicines anti-retroviral since . .
So For what continues lingers deaths .
To me me seems that the problem not is the access to treatment .
So what what case us has happened in our hospital .
At least in the recent years not have had had the medicine the problem is that the patients best-seller very advanced because tension his state the infection or make in stages late the the disease .
It a custodianship overwhelming &apos; Nine the each ten patients best-seller when already similar some infection instrumental what that is has that do for having a greater impact on the mortality global is do verdicts more more and for what therefore is have that offer tests the detection the function mass to all the people that what cost-intensive &apos; .
In his proposal implementing specialists and officials of Council imposition the Prevention of AIDS in in in also the own patients as as cast turned to shouldn the test to a laboratory particular only drove because what had fact a friend and despite to his shorter age already was in stage the AIDS and even even even the the , a tumour cancerous that is a the the complications common .
All changing when quite that future AIDS .
Some considerably that is van to die and not want know nothing .
&apos; If already me question to die best me me three sometimes to the week &apos; say not in my case .
The change was for improve me food well successfully exercise seriously the medicines .
To the date their parents only know that that cancer .
