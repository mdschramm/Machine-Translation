In the families of children with obesity not exist practice of Brusselsu'\u2019way sports what opened is applicable to the majority of the families current where only the % of the children replied that their parents the least a time for week lie time to the exercise physical.
Survey ; to children.
The survey is completed to end of last year school and participated in the same almost children of Education Básica the whole Liberec.
already was the second edition of programme the &apos; The obesity the not a casualidad &apos; that supports the Compañía the certain Sanitario General and the company Unilever.

A dieta suitable and quite exercise in family are those determinantes that are decrease administration the number of children with obesity and even obesity.

However Breakfast but with embutido for dinner.
The specialists avisan the that the one development healthy are important addition the details that also count as for example have a hour scorning for the Breakfast in family.
In Liberec not however only the % of the families of schoolchildren desayunan to the same hour.
In the majority of the families each one desayuna only.
But what worst was compromising that the % of the homes not been desayuna nothing.
The Breakfast is no however the basis of a dieta daily right.
The study shows that the rules families of children overweight is consume with great more frequently the insanas potatoes fritas.
Almost all regardless of weight intrusively to daily refrescos dulces 70 ).

&apos; The preferences food of the children Czech in active 25-to-30 between the and years since the point of view of a food healthy are very everyday the what ideal &apos;.
Among their food favourite is lie the pasta the meat and the dulces.
&apos; It on all alarming the popularity of the refrescos dulces &apos; is smoker in the report final the study.
As food main is brings the palma the pasta and you still the close the meat the ave.
Virtually the children reject always the legumbre and the taste for the fish and the child is very under.

The estilista has the be also a good psychologist maintain the professionals.
In the article introductorio How learn the estilistas already me quejé a little to the rules lessons initial already were quite cargadas.
not had not idea of how accrue achieved.
Conferencias the three professionals of ramo how tight to resolute problem and addition a seminar on how does the world of industry.
And be worst.
observance more closely are the examinations late more information and tasks practices us aguardan.
And although the course is develops each Saturday and Sunday already not wider a alfiler.
We increasingly have studied with the director Alena ( the course not there circumstances man on how tight to the woman to do has a simetría perfect.
And case is the great majority.
&apos;So is cuellicorto someone has a Through estilizada without the curvas practices and someone suffering obesity.
The estilista has the new arise ópticamente few shoulders anchos alargar a bottleneck or recrear the curvas necessary.
We have prioritised revealed noticed on how do emphasise the body the women of type of Jennifer Valverde the pechos and caderas enormous but cintura close and the same time not vestirla the one Similarly too desafiante.
If for example the difference between the cintura and the caderas is never to the member or the trousers not been adaptan purpose the worth shouldn coser the least a piece of jeopardized extra to measure.
However doubt not been arrepentirán because the clothes that erecting perfectly is impagable.
With a member to measure is agreed a better to have a that not to the start levantarse baila in the cintura etc.
The body estilizado is can afford tight clothes with pliegues adornos bordados or drapeados.
There lag many types of information variety and the bodies case that am readjust the that correspondence the whole of week for put agenda in my head across this information.
E even so me fear that with the task asignada already have more to the well-known.
To each participant in the course is you have allocated two famous to the that preferably solutions two vestuarios each for the day and other to the night.
There that have to account the aspect current the lifestyle of fashionable that is adecue to the person in question.
I has tocado &apos; tight &apos; to Miranda Kerr perhaps the conozcáis the campaign of Victoria la Lloyd Secret.
Grito for inside for me is a better to you example Britney Spears or Christina Aguilera that topical will engordado few hundred 75-kilo for favour Rather in mind the excessive , or the jovencísima Selena Gómez.
The orange-coloured have to recortarlos the rules journals or buscarlos in Internet and imprimirlos for after elaborarlos illustrating.
The moodboard that is as is way to result completely speaks addition our lifestyle personal and our relationship with the design gráfico.
It important also thinking in the part gráfica of estilismo.
The estilista for both not viste only physically but that also been ranks for example of the pages of products in the journals the subjects concrete as trends bolsos coats etc ..
Indeed everything that we stood the estilista and leather Mario Kameník.
But everything that already is to the Sunday.
The estilista has the having a vision global.
The three guests specialists provided the conference of Saturday with information on all type of bodies.
The estilista Honza Pokorný the leather the young Jakub Polanka and the fotógrafo the young Ben Renč.
Jakub us reminded that the young is a illusion and the estilista should saberle cash party to this.
And a good estilista knows work with a same prenda the tight the forms variety.
The variabilidad is in this case fundamental.
So the stand gabardina or as they in English trench-coat is can tight to what anti-Semitism with vaqueros and camiseta but also serves to wear the body half-naked with shoes of tacón and fotografiarlo as if were in reality a clothing.
Or well enough arremangarla and higher the bottleneck for obtain a image completely differently.
&apos; Jugad with this &apos; us assigned.
applies that more valoro is the next advice &apos; For begin to work ago lack that those conozcáis all the rules &apos;.
&apos; Then already look romperlas &apos; said Jakub.
For end me is clear for what memorizamos all those Interesting what is condemnatory with what we do if then is that the rules journals the young us encountered results profits.
That without talk of the desfiles.
Thank the fotógrafo Ben know that a estilista has to have more types of clothes in the reserve the that intended fotografiar.
So for a history of fashionable that purchase ten pages for both ten outfits there is having splendid lists for use , the least fifteen.
And addition to the fine the clothes works in combination with other prendas all them different to the that is mines in the reality.
All doing there is all the account the hour of solutions the outfit.
Honza Pokorný us assured that the image and the lifestyle Neurodegenerative them by the many cases the half of success.
Enough indifferently to Madonna that not a precisely a singer extraordinary but the image and the márquetin have done in her a star global.
In Liberec for the moment not there still a trend clear to use the services in the estilistas.
far the eventual famous also what lie useless me mere my skills my aspect physical not has never importance ..
And when someone us pida our services are the having to account the is very likely to us indiquen a stature very differently to the yours real unemployed ..
Then only is guglear and physically if the journals of our already been writing on the issue if a certain celebridad has engordado adelgazado etc.
The Sunday Honza and Mario us insistieron in the estilista not him enough orientarse in the young but that is that understand the outfit.
During his work on all been must communicate with the people to the that viste for this is a fundamental be a good psychologist.
dumb appreciate to the people not been ago the least reasoning their views.
&apos; When a director you contrata for the him clasifiquéis the vestuario and is what completéis with prendas fine not look tonightu'\u2019s and they everything we that in and say &apos; huy what horror &apos;.
&apos; Encontrad the least a couple of things that podáis ponderar and recommend for the someone is the conclusion put &apos; says Mario.
dear same also us daring to all must caber in the so-called &apos; placovka &apos; is say the expansion of work.
This is scorning around the cintura and is have there all the tools necessary.
are items as nail as nail quitapelusas or imperdibles There also balance of nailon that you serves the estilista during the session of fine the products such that bolsos or gorros pinzas special the enganche the prendas for front if this would greater the alfileres and other type of enganches not are permitidos , therefore could reputation the fabric , or a game of remnant.
For not remain in the usual pasiva and put something in practice have learned to revestir the suela the shoes.
Even during the sessions the fine in the study in a surface flat is chosen reputation the suela and a more still the outside.
And not stayed more to revestir and revestir.
not composure touch the shoes with the nail for not dañarlos for accident.
So that in the be very hábil.
Mario me has thus a joy the tribute my work without reservations.
The truth is that not been me babies very well matters skills.
This is only a small part of all the that we sometimes during everything the end of week in the second part of course.
already me have prioritised account the commit to estilismo to level professional not a road to reflect but me five-minute exactly Like what is used to people.
In Need degradation Speed chosen Run is competing for all America.
Reseña.
A journey in principle despreocupado is complicates to cause of a series of descuidos impropios the one journey routine during the Question the morning.
In certain measure is he developing the expectations but that not serves the nothing if the reality not been intended do nothing exceptional.
The new handing to the that the title is adds chosen Run adherents large expectations already before the his estreno.
Prometía that lead new aires to the former saga the place Need degradation Speed and to its the what shown permeating as a game to do should overcome remains another increasingly a gender the action without more.
also us devices curiosos for new how Einstein the scenes insertadas where the personage main share of car and walking for their own ordinary.
As always pattern in the series of NFS the results not profit great thing regard to what is our conferences.
There race-going that is can give you tonnage but in the cómputo total is and points to cause of failings absurd that already been apareciendo in the series since ago years.
In reality not been can or blend errors but that is about more well the desgana incomprehensible the programadores.
The adventure starts very well.
They you predictability in a history whose regard Nicklaus has revealed problems personal for resolverlos is you provides participate in a career illegal for all America.
Os sentáis the volante in the coast leg-traps in St Archduke and your mission is expressed the first to New York.
The idea is offer something interesting.
The route is divided in ten stages and then in more of fifty race-going.
Indeed doing is follows that every career has place for a route differently and the stages are localizadas in profits earthu'\u2019s that findings quite various and interesting.
Indeed that Similarly each not has not remotamente the feeling of the game offer always what same.
Some the land findings even agradables to the view although the level technical of gráfico is equivalent to the mistreatment previous the series.
For therefore not a nothing of other world.
But the walk for the desert the landscape otoñal or the highest mountains covered the snow dairy a effect identity very atmosphere.
Moreover the place is diversifican the time in when we a element atípico.
So for example in the desert you encontráis a storm the part to tonight the visibility.
In change in the mountains there is having care for the not be sepulte a avalancha.
According that every a the rules race-going is very well less-developed.
Only there a couple of models but with this enough.
During a moment intentáis adelantar to a amount of rival exigida what normal in a career classical , later tratáis the win time duel anti-Semitism cronometrado and then we expected a day against a only adversario.
In half of all this permeating to sometimes the police that not ago but obstruct still more the things.
The ARGO are the landscape outside the car.
They similar animaciones interactivas when Nicklaus in the majority of the cases has the escape the someone and out suits that ayudarlo always pulsando the botón fair in the moment fair.
Nothing complicated.
hard surprising without however that very behaving least landscape in the game of this is reflection wait in concrete there only three ..
But the result final is positive because this element not at the be some and in the context already mentioned is one of the elements that are the game implement more interesting.
The model of driver continues to fingerprints the episodes previous.
That wants say that the day of today already not make great thing but not been can that make bad.
If buscáis a simulación realistic already look seek in other hand.
But to a career office-bound with quite action him two-track quite this lifestyle of driver although benefits find something best between the games the competition.
far here everything in order.
But the problems emerge later the one true time.
To difference of this correct the models the severe already not happens what same with the collisions.
Indeed games the issue type not wider wait to recree deformaciones and collisions complicated but the fact before the one coup against any subjected not look predict how reaccionará vuestro prosecution with what opened not all is in order.
It typical that the do a adelantamiento very ajustado or movement the cars with a traffic normal so only regret commercial roces but in other situations almost identical vuestro prosecution ends doing piruetas descontroladas.
Or even ends completely destroyed.
Thank the system of reseteo not emerge large problems but can poneros the wrong humour.
The reseteos are programados the stand manner that when sufres a accident or you sales the track the game you restituye the last point of rescue in the track.
However in every career only is disposal of five reseteos available.
If the consumís all suits that restart the career since the principle.
So therefore not a more to a aid in case of the something not satisfied well but not a very the fiar.
To sometimes nor the reseteo aid only aid the aprenderse the stage confusion of memory.
A great disadvantage of game is that the ourselves facts is echo in profits places.
In some curvas for example there is possible to a manner specific the other Similarly are gone to taken.
Others sometimes you encontráis in some website vehicles &apos; civilians &apos; always with the same configuration although estéis the first quintos or lleguéis five minutes before or later.
This ago the rabiar on all the situations when veis that two autos that van the meeting in directions Autonomy your contrincante adelanta without problems but when llegáis debéis girar or well tenaciously.
It Like when lleguéis because is programmed for the &apos; surprise &apos; always will front of your narices.
The adversaries have addition a advantage more.
During across the starting llegaréis to places where without having to account the moment always be adelantará the same adversario in the same place.
Moreover this case the end of the starting in a long bridge what opened is still more chocante.
Vuestro oponente must reaching before the sort the price is whether.
When goes front of out you lengthy the vision of the autos that disgraceful the face it is the principle can do papilla the car.
They can understand the idea of creating a game with maximum structures of suspense and adrenalina but the execution is that Apparent that surely you decepcione Yes.
And is a worth because although the model of journey make simple the game is it and with action to Similarly that the often not a possible continue to detail what is happening nor where.
And really five-minute Like if the merit is brings the idea with fifty runway standardise or the classification in the career for the not quepa the platitude or any other thing.
A idea inhabitual is the change the autos during the place.
have that be vigilant to the surtidores the petrol the hand the road because precisely Hence suits that change the cars although the great majority of the cases we suffice what is suits.
The autos is divided in three categories.
The sports are Will for areas urban the autos strong Americans for the motorways rectas and the exóticos superdeportivos for a severe technical for example for roads of mountains with curvas.
Moreover balance narrativo main also permeating a balance of challenges parallel is say there race-going in places concrete to conoceréis for the stories.
Here conseguiréis not only medals but also points of experience for vuestro profile that serves therefore to the challenges as the cuentos.
At achieve the level higher the driver is you open several possibilities starting for the cars and acabando with funds for the profile.
At same time there conectada a role Autolog in line to preceding vuestros results with the other players and disponibiliza other functions All.
One the elements more difficult to understand that how is benefit the final career in the history.
With the car llegáis until the end of metre proceeding , where we ponéis to flow to shameful for the tracks proceeding ..
The velocímetro you brand between and km h proceeding and the suddenly for behind you all the convoy of metre and is you get for front without more.
In the wording surely harmonise a debate on this for several days on whether during the programming of game none thought even a little or if the authors of truth us leave for a buffoons the bobos.
The part technical of game not a nothing exceptional but the least the effects visuales broadly findings in the majority of the cases agradables to sometimes until soberbios.
Well what worth that the moment more tensos is reduces the quality of image and in times the one Similarly serious.
This affects on all the accidents where there involucrados many participants when the quality of image continual already not a valid.
The audio is well and the broadband sonora is a question of tastes.
To end of the make the designation to the main part of group youth the broadband sonora belongs to the category &apos; each one of their father and the his mother &apos; but is can resorted to nobody torment the game only by their music.
The feeling final the Need degradation Speed chosen Run is therefore quite confused.
If the game evitase errors absolutely questioners us probably problems in decision to chosen Run is the best game of NFS the past years.
tortoise-like the feeling of the game not deliver completed.
The diversión is asegurada but preparaos because the errors you slap in the eyes with the strength of years reflectores the airport.

The basis of this nature largoplacista the clear the first head of the signing the vision Greek A4-0552 addressing Mr.
already him coined the slogan of the many problems of world have solution if the people is ready to consider.
Their motto &apos; Think &apos; is became the his stamped in around the opened was fare federalist the life of future .Latin was also the title of a magazine internal that IBM began to publish in ).
addressing was addition the basis of a culture of company Great levantada.
&apos; For us IBM involves a thinking to long-term term a movement continuous in direction to future.
IBM has sobrevivido and current during hundred years for this reason because is remained faithful to their principles baseline but without salient to the changes around.
That us has allowed during our first century so-called the technology the business and the society.
expect fruit still more in our second century &apos; stated during their anniversary the current director of the company Samuel A4-0552 Palmisano.
A system sofisticado.
addressing already in the years is preocupó of care of their employees as the entrepreneur the Baťa in Liberec the employees of IBM were the first workforce American that gozaron the holiday pagadas safe , uniform elegant and a sofisticado system of pay the premiaba to the best inventores and sellers.
The same sofisticación to long-term term the remains IBM in the relationship with the client.
already since the principle the company learned compromising talentos the be a the rules initial companies world in overcome with any kind of discrimination could.&apos; choose without problems ..
In the online the strategy Anti-discrimination is the plan current the IBM for the that the Palmisano what sustituirá the year the next a woman Virginia Rometty.
She already has working thirty years in IBM where the been head of sales márquetin and strategies.
During the past years IBM has participated in the naked events portals rain the ideas in line of the that emerge redesign the future strategies and profound.
not is the availability that sobren ideas therefore in the signing employed almost half million of people.
A institution with good reputable.
The position scorning in the business underground to the company a image internal and external strong.
&apos; Since the principle IBM remained a concept of institution more to the company technological &apos; claims to Gari teacher of the Harvard Best School and autora of books on IBM Rosabeth Moss Kanter.
&apos; IBM not a company technological but a company that staying resolve problems of business for users of the technology &apos; puntualiza Orwell Colony the consultora Forrester Roslin.
As the own company says exists a difference between specific in the business and create directly a bn.
IBM or the &apos; Great Green &apos; as is the motion in the euro familiarmente to cause of their logo is the become the past hundred years in a the elderly companies of world.
It possibly the company technological more versátil develops therefore teams as programmes infrastructure and services sanitation website inside the one wider range of services that van since humble until nanotecnología ..

not all the products and profound suffer the satisfy the taste of the customers and the moment IBM not apostó for their own system operational OS 2 services in line Prodigy or computers IBM PCjr ..
&apos; If his bn is based in press not be anclarse emotionally in the past &apos; extended Samuel A4-0552 Palmisano.
For that IBM not has problems in building their foundations in other platforms and equally if not work to abandon ..
And doing the difference of the competition Microsoft that basically is keeps and chunk always exclusively with Windows.
Technology the future.
In issue of sales IBM is withdrawing on all the services in the that approximately a fifth part of the programmes and other fifth of equipment.
With everything still in the equipment represented more of the half of the quota the suppliers.
To onwards of year IBM has meantime assets of lower performance for a value total of thousand million of dollars During in the same period , has investments thousand million of dollars in the purchasing the technology the future.
The investments have followed since , when we first time is manifested the modern crisis financial global.
IBM action according to premises of their first head Greek A4-0552 addressing cast during the great crisis economic of rate the investment.
seems that until now the company IBM has Ali capear the crisis.
The value of the actions of IBM since the beginning of year has grown estratosféricamente until a % of interests net of the company not been allowed to increase.
The motto of IBM is this all unless his value.
They can therefore wait to when bits the next crisis this .Latin flexible aguantará.

How have evolved the prices of the travel since.
far had the Czechoslovakia the then only five agencies the travel state no-fly Čedok Sporturist CKM Rekrea and Autoturist.
The agencies the travel to the moment vendían in the majority of the cases travel only the block socialist therefore the travel to West were very restringidos.
The tourists Czech assurances for both the holiday to the beaches of the systems Republic Democratic differed to the Union Soviet , Sochi in Crimea in the Sea Black to Bulgaria and Romania sides in the Sea Black and to Hungary ( Balaton ..
A exception positive was the period possible between and when are chosen travel to Yugoslavia without however , later the regime yugoslavo is inclinó towards the west and the travel to the tourists Czech were then quite restringidos.
A great paradoxically the socialism was the fact that the citizens of bloc socialist or make also to the Checoeslovacos not been cut permitiese travel free and dreaming nor even for the countries socialists.
If a citizen wanted travel dreaming for example to Poland or to the Union Soviet Widespread a letter of invitation if not the journey individual not was possible.
The agencies the journey ofrecían in Especially times also travel to West but one is supposed put to the pattern with a lump the ball and pass case across the night or having &apos; good known &apos; in the agency.
still case not all was cattle.
The so-called &apos; promise the change &apos; that was the condition for the travel to West not been concedía to the &apos; People politically little reliable &apos; that it not could.&apos; travel in absolute.
The currency checoslovaca not was a currency freely converted and without guarantee of change not was possible obtain the resources to currency Western for travel to West.
The great majority of the Czech 1990s their holiday in its own country for this is in a great number of bonemeal and houses the summer the Czech adquirían This practice still the.
The Similarly the travel to the Czech has suffered since a bona revolution.
Meanwhile that until for us was the not going more pass the holiday in the systems or Bulgaria the year past the Czech Those million of travel to holiday to countries of all the world.
hard nna great paradoxically the that today day already not of views the fact the that the destination currently odds-on Croatia until not been could.&apos; travel freely because draft part of the Yugoslavia the then.
To principles of the years is payment the exemption of visa for travel to the States neighbours the Europe Western what is set a wave enormous the visits to shorter long-term sobretodo to Vienna or Germany.
The checoeslovacos during a time not been pretended hartos the rules excursiones the West everything the world wanted anybody the what least for a moment.
For example in Paris dormían the groups of Czech in the parks in shops the campaign already the citizens income of then not we permitían pay a hotel or pension.
A feature typical of the Czech the time was the utmost brought to food canned Imitation etc to save.
Another moment important was the introduction of the convertibilidad the maximum Czech case our tourists could finally later the decades buy freely currency Western.
Our level of life aumentaba and with him also the wages media what is around the set a increase in the demand the travel.
With the increase the demand the travel detected the agencies to onwards the with regularly to prepare the travel came to direct the flights chárter what is did waited incredibly the prices of the travel in comparison with the past thanks to the possibility of obtaining 66 for the size of passengers.
To late to the of century past already the Czech sailors without visa to almost all the countries developed except US what opened simplificó still more our travel.
Another moment interesting in the history of tourism pos-revolucionario 90s already in the when was organised thanks to a huge demand the first flight direct since Liberec to a country exótico , and was to Thailand.
Since time year proceed all the years flights chárter direct with tourists Czech was countries distant and calurosos This winter already been volará directly from Liberec to destinations exóticos.
The countries exóticos the grades currently closely the thousand Czech the year.
Another moment interesting to this time to symbolises our development pos-revolucionario arrived in the year ..
The November the euro squeezed the visa for the tourists Czech , with what is our country Commissioneru'\u2019s to be between the countries more developed the world.
In the Czech for first time in its history have past more of the half of their holiday in the abroad 50,3 ) and for first time in its history is the Malawi in travel to abroad more of thousand NOK Czech for head including the costs in the website of stay.
Convocada Assembly General Ordinaria for one to president the could overcome the new in point dead.
Since ago almost five months the football Czech is no chairman and is likely to the successor the Ivan Hašek as President the Federation Czech the Futbol FAČR , not been conocerá nor after the competition the next Assembly General Extraordinaria that effect place this Thursday in Nymburk.
Indeed fact still not been has come to a agreement on the rules of vote to continue.
However the same not been How vote even for one between the three candidates.
The interested to presidir the football Czech are Jindřich Rajchl Miroslav Pelta and Tomáš Paclík.
Hašek renunció to their office in June not without before rectify to their colleagues with the purpose of find a person strong that supiese afflicted of football in the future.
However later the conclude the era Hašek is brutality a conflict between the two federaciones the partnership incapable of reaching to a agreement for decisions a candidate common.
of became the obvious the September when had to be elected the new president.
The delegates the Assembly General is gathered in vain in the White National Národní dům Administrative in the formal praguense the Smíchov , because the discussions are previously blocked and not only in question the method of election.
not is arrived to circumstances consensus nor in question to whom in the Assembly General had right to vote just the representatives legal or also the bank with non-citizen powers.
To onwards the period moment and because the issue unique point is in a agreement part-time broadly also for the other the Institute the state and law according to opened the representation for non-citizen powers not a possible.
However the disputes on the code electoral continuing open.
Over light on the situation already not could glasshouses nor the Committee Executive that the their meetings ordinarias or extraordinary basically not Vihear nothing.
The opinion on the possibility of vote has changed a couple of times already but the point incapacitated continues remains the same.
The question is the next So the what function proceed in the third round for avoid the point dead.
&apos; The dispute novel in around the if is how proceed to agree with the estatutos or find another model &apos; says Dušan Svoboda each of the three vicepresidentes the FAČR that since the direction of the partnership represents the futbol professional.
According the model proposed in the estatutos in the third round win time candidate to purchase greater percentage of support the federation to the opened Accession his candidacy.
The Region the Moravia is ready to reach to a compromise for the conclusion win time candidate with a greater percentage total of votes in both federaciones.
The part bohemia without however rigidly the condition of the winner according these calculations porcentuales installed having to majority of the least two thirds.
&apos; This him quitaría without however the sense to the two rounds previous and negaría for completely the concept of system bicameral &apos; case is as Svoboda pastu'\u2019, the us to the part morava according what opened what better would not touch the agenda and voting according the estatutos schemes.
With what said surprisingly is the agreement also Tomaš Paclík although is it is the regulation electoral established by the estatutos the all the candidate two-track more to Pelta.
&apos; I like to being votara the maximum of agreement with the estatutos &apos;.
&apos; For that not been inventen none tontería onset of the representatives as the final Assembly General &apos; says the cold the Victoria Plzen that is postula for first time as candidate and the aimed their comments mainly in against the Pelta.
Pelta continues remains positive.
According him in Nymburk is for on the new president and to believes that the candidate in the future cooperaran the function engagement.
&apos; All the pasiones is apaciguarán with the party the today the group team national in the Campeonato European.
&apos; The football same to be in and it is cooperara more to adjust &apos; claims the representative of Jablonice that the three candidates has more experience in management of football therefore to level professional as regional.
Rajchl is the most reluctant.
&apos; hope that is comes to a agreement but for Unfortunately the situation is a more difficult &apos;.
&apos; not been talking of conflict between bohemios and moravos but there attempts to ajustar the rules to their own convenience &apos;.
&apos; This can take as consequence a new deadlock the Assembly General &apos;.
&apos; Indeed all anyway hope that is band the sense common &apos; said Rajchl.
already not remains a time to the all the parties blended to a agreement.
Some negotiations resulted that need to Montenegro but who can know until the start the party if the team of football consist completely.
The aeroplane special in the that resulted that with the Podgorica between other the vicepresidentes Dalibor Kucera and Rajchl not been won this morning for problems technical in Prague taking the owns a alternative to carry to part of committee executive the place where noon place the party the classification.
Quizas the meeting decisive for all could be the that effect place to level ministerial that according count was 20 this Wednesday.
To Josef Dobeš minister of Education Youth and Deportes him like a integrate to the parties divided to the organisation integrating more powerful of country to the are comes to a agreement.
There much in game the benefits state of credibility of football and also the next Assembly General of Committee central the federation checoslovaca of sport ČSTV that awareness instruments the one new direction to sport Czech after the problems financial the house of loterías Sazka.
Paclík luchará for achieving the presidency because not got a candidate more adequate.
If the head of the futbolistas the Pilsen Tomaš Paclik before the Assembly General extraordinary conociera the name of a candidate adequate to satisficiese all its ideas on the new president of the Federation Czech the Fútbol FAČR , nor is introduce as candidate to a number that relevant.
&apos; If liked a person suitable excellent fighting for her and not me introduce as candidate to the elections &apos;.
&apos; But until the day of today not been has shown find a person case &apos; said Paclík for the Agency the Noticias Czech ČTK.
applies that justifies to Paclík to take the challenge with Miroslav Pelta and Henry Rajchl is exactly the possibility of block to Pelta the course the rules elections to opens the road to the presidency of the Federation Czech the Futbol FAČR ..
Paclík also puntualiza that the case win permanecería in the office of president only until , when long-overdue the Question the assembly general ordinary.
In that office him like see the one expert and good workforce that not deliver too connected with the events fans.
&apos; already have spoken with a people to the that could have to account &apos;.
&apos; For me was a madness hear the some say that the issue moment nor even want identify with the football Czech &apos;.
&apos; I like change this vision &apos; adds.
applies that supposed more bother to Paclík in this moment is the relationship of Pelta with the President the Partnership the Fútbol Regional the Pilsen Pianist Berbr a man with a past controversial known outside the mundillo as a poderoso lobista with capacity of influence in the vote in the bank in the assembly general.
For Paclík is that unacceptable see the Pelta upper in the sillón presidential.
&apos; In case of the gane is scarcely the status unlicensed and nothing to the football change &apos;.
&apos; With the support the Berbra a man of business ambitious the football surrendering still less advantage &apos; said Paclík.
Menciona also the fact the that makes few years the name of Pelta was e-commerce with a Sahara telephone during the research the one case of corruption of the opened Pelta went impune.
&apos; not know what prestige the football could attract the victory of Pelta &apos;.
&apos; And with what eyes us plead the UEFA and the FIFA &apos; said Paclík that also decision-making with certain caution his declaration previous to &apos; vendería the Club Pilsen if Pelta is ridiculed in president &apos;.
In the case of win the elections of Thursday Paclík could arise the cooperation with Pelta in the future.
Indeed same opinion is the other candidate Rajchl that has been supported by Paclík before the Assembly General the September that is in a fiasco.
&apos; dear Pelta would the areas the that solitary &apos;.
&apos; It very capable &apos;.
&apos; I what could imagine for example as chief of the representation &apos;.
&apos; but not as workforce the one partnership &apos;.
&apos; I either meto the narices there where not me sorry capable &apos; added Paclík that the September suscitó lot attention for support the suspension of the Commission the Árbitros presidida for Ludek Macel potential later for Dagmar Damkova.
Paclík accepts that is atrevería to manage the partnership.
Recurre to their capacities of discharge the rules companies private therefore since the summer past is also the Director-General of Pilsen that with their support legalising in May the triunfo in first division.
&apos; I strength for change some things in the field of football and contribution to their practice safe &apos;.
&apos; For reduce the influence the some groups of pressure to probably tend to influence in the decisions of committee refunded and the Appellate Libya situations unpleasant said Paclík without hidden their antipatías towards the president of Sparta Daniel Křetínský.
A the rules priorities also be the consolidate the relationship between the FAČR and the Committee Olímpico Checo with the aid of opened ejercía pressure on the leaders politicians for the programmes more money to sport the tax the lottery.
&apos; It each of the problems key to the are should anti-smoking the new president &apos;.
&apos; If aumentaran the tax on the games the gambling as we anuncian the parties politicians support their arguments but blatantly have to Emma where goes to stop everything this money &apos; Other.
Ademas Paclík now not has the account even its partnership with the Club Pilsner although him same claims to the President the FAČR must be &apos; not adviser &apos;.
Pelta is to their time e-commerce with Jablonec and Rajchl with Dukla the Prague.
&apos; not a ideal &apos;.
&apos; But not see sense to fact the yield hypocritically my actions of Club the Pilsen to another person to remain again there after a year and half &apos; said Paclík.
Pelta promised to the FAČR new estatutos that acabarían with the point dead the rules elections.
Two days before the Assembly General the Partnership the Fútbol each of the candidate to the presidency Miroslav Pelt promised to the case of a elected Coordinating that the FAČR mayor few new estatutos that sirvieran definitive for deal in the future the controversy in question the regulation electoral.
The representative of Jablonec is set in question to the meeting of this Thursday in Nymburk and believes that the conflict preelectoral could important towards a solution today with the possible victory of team of football.
already before the rules elections not mean in September Pelta promised excesses in case of a elected precisely in the representation and in custom funds.
Decidió participate in the last minute in the final assembly general for this is this postponed to two months him could go well for defend and submit in a context more broader their ideas on the management of football.
&apos; The People the all the levels are ranks of football already ago a time and expected fortunate this Thursday the new President &apos;.
&apos; Sienten that has come to hour of the someone gestione the partnership &apos; thinks the man to being couples mainly with the Club the Jablonice but that worked in the Sparta and in the committee executive the Partnership.
For this reason believes having enough experience for manage the football Czech.
Has convinced that behind the problems current with the elections is the euphoria that hung in the time to Ivan Hašek.
&apos; Unfortunately in the Assembly general the June were approved the estatutos that not were very lifts as all felt &apos;.
&apos; If excluimos find interpretations have a president already been September &apos; warned Pelta.
exact the readaptación of document more important to the Partnership Cívica is usó as señuelo for gain to the bank.
&apos; If me eligen president me what counts as a challenge personal and am ready to answer in case of the this falle &apos;.
&apos; It a question of principles without the speaker not we as &apos; says Pelta.
Moreover in theory staying not Hanish with their opponents.
already in the past had Sinclaire that is financially mercy with Henry Rajchl the that respects for their training in law remains restrictions the that his oponente would addition his first Vice-President.
already was a time without foremost to Greek Paclík cast the contrary to Pelta not showed pawn with head.
&apos; scarf more of a year in the world of football and already been achieved some successes &apos;.
&apos; Their attacks but were vergonzosos and lot People became amazed for the campaign electoral &apos;.
&apos; For that many of them dudan on its real character &apos; said to their election Pelta that still remains faithful to the statements situation already in September.
Their weapon more powerful is according to their knowledge of football since the competition more lowest until the management.
This final should be escaparate the promotion of football.
&apos; also intentaría deal all the escándalos that early to cause of the Bohemians as consequence of scandal of corruption of year past &apos;.
&apos; Immediately later me involucraría in the negotiations with the sector public and the private for ensure that very enough money for all the football &apos; said ago two months to the ČTK the candidate the years.
To continuation also promised to their appointment as president of football not comportaría none modification personal the plantilla.

To despite the scenarios doomsday current that is vaticinan foremost the next assembly general him believes that the bank not Tens in vain this Thursday to Nymburk.
&apos; If the only point of disagreement be how vote in the third round without doubt that allowing overcome.
&apos; The football needs credibility the opened was assured only if we all has a leader &apos; still two days before the wording more decisive in its career of representative Pelta continues remains positive.
Rajchl promised to lower their leadership the FAČR empezaría to work with dwell.
If in the fourth Assembly General its elected the current Vice-President Jindrich Rajchl as new president of the Partnership the Fútbol Czech lot People is showing surely resentida.
Rajchl promised to the case of a elected is trabajaría blow.

&apos; And asignaré tasks difficult to the football conclusion in every one of these segmentos continue forward with a boost &apos;.
&apos; To lot People this probably not him gustará because busies begin to work very hard and not just criticise the work of the others &apos; added.
Due to the atmosphere of criticism in the movement futbolístico is says that has considered to possibility of not stand the new as candidate.
&apos; all know that work hours joys &apos;.
&apos; But need know that this effect sense and the not be People behind the my that you ISD-2 and obstaculizará to each step &apos; mover case the reasons the his indecisión.
&apos; Many People me has said that not please contacted for Source because then is Choice for vencidos also the others &apos;.
&apos; They talking to have faith for not leave it without more &apos; said.
According say him justifies also continue to work to already began with Hašek.
&apos; During those two years is better a great part of work to do you that now been vanish &apos;.
&apos; exist processes that is previously started and the appeal his effect inside the one couple of years and not me like to someone the pare &apos; announced Belgian for the fact the that if eligieran the other candidate Miroslav Pelta the situation in the partnership could again to be stand as was before the time to Hašek.
&apos; I believe in the agenda and is something that the my opinion Mirek Pelta not a capable of maintain.
&apos; Underlying the him is on all across fights People that is ocuparía of football for the outside only a privileged to few ironed elected &apos;.
&apos; They me can reprochar a lot of things but not the fact the that am to favour of someone &apos;.
&apos; defend be objective &apos;.
&apos; want do a football for all because only way is sentirán well all and not only the elected &apos; said Rajchl.
indiscriminate also the idea that only serious Karlsbad the president.
&apos; Although some people seeking Can what contrary have to function do what maximum for Moravia &apos;.
&apos; For example is hour of thinking in the fact the division the second division in a part Czech and in other morava whose winners irían to the first division &apos;.
&apos; not been virtual the situation current in the that have only three teams the Moravia what is represents a problem for the players moravos young &apos; said Rajchl.
Although to the pugna the rules elections presidential is sumó Tomaš Paclík president of Club Pilsner Rajchl not leaves a believing in their possibilities of a elected.
&apos; still sorry having a strong support the Federation Czech the opened me checked as its Vice-President and the knows that behind the heart there successes Clarity &apos; said Rajchl whose successes &quot; the saving the should tens of millions of NOK the contracts desventajosos the negotiations to contracts televisivos and the negotiations on the law of the lottery.
For another side recognises his part of fault in the federation not deliver united.
And while civilized that Pelta is &apos; descalificado for recover the confidence in the football Czech &apos; viewed the other contravention Paclík as a candidate strong that yes has something that offer the football.
&apos; Nobody can deny that was a great work for the Pilsen time year &apos;.
&apos; In the case of the make elected probably here we that already began Ivan Hašek and not cambiaria the function significantly the plantilla of staff in the soothe &apos;.
&apos; not want use that the my favour &apos; evalúa case to their rival Rajchl.

Finally the sum of balance of the UBS in was more of five times greater the results economic the Switzerland see gráfica ..
&apos; not we go to rescue to the UBS &apos; said Geiger expert in banca.
To the first disaster is joined the second.
Few months later the UBS capituló in a conflict fiscal with America and is prepared ready to limits the data the customers wealthiest that possibly previously defraudado taxes with aid of bank.
Moreover whereby a figure of thousands of millions of dollars reimbursed the benefits injustificados the state business with a compensation for payment.
With doing the UBS confesó more or less ought helped in the fraud fiscal.
Simultáneamente lost something that in been since always his capital in the competition for customers rich the aureola the concept.
After the scandal the secret of bank blessing already not a the same.
To this continued to answer the president of the junta directive and the president of advice administrative.
And the displacement of the funds to the customers.
Indeed this meant in few months the bank lost their credibility in their two sectors central in the banca the investment prohibited the reference flawed and in the administration of goods prohibited the aid to fraud fiscal.
And fair when readjust to be something more relaxed fair when are meant that the UBS readjust to do happens this desdichada history of changing a operators individual defraudó thousand million of euros before the that the bank is diera account of the something cards bad.
And is desveló for this seen this still not work well with the management of risk in the banca the investment.
&apos; With the case Adoboli is patent to the controls the risk have changed too little &apos; claims Martin Janssen professor of economy and finance in the Institute Bancario the University the Zurich.
The director financial the one great bank German also is safe &apos; The problem of the UBS is that not dominates the controls the risk &apos;.
For what is emerged the idea of the caution with the that the bankers Swiss is demands since ago time that the guardian of the elderly property of world circumstances risk too large in change the safety of money wants quebrar the other hand the republic sanctity.
The deposits the safety of the banks Swiss were the symbol of the reliability inquebrantable as Lindt and Sprüngli of chocolate genuine.
The central the UBS in Zurich not Exclusion with the buzz of sound bank private blessing only a little greater.
The situation is classical.
The bank has its headquarters main in the streets Bahnhofstraße the Zurich that goes since the station main directly the lago the Zurich enmarcado for the summits covered the snow the rules mountains suizas.
Here the buildings are ostentosos the writing are few of the most salaries of Europe.
Here is lie joyerías as Tiffany`s between business traditional Swiss as the confitería Sprüngli.
Here appropriately since ago years the banks Swiss since the bank national happening for the palace the Credit Suisse until the elitarios banks private as Julius Bär.
They enters in the clear the reception the UBS prohibited a heavy door chair.
Soon the walls are revestidas the mármol front is lie large sillones the leather together the logo of bank there a great letrero for indicate the &apos; safety &apos;.
The UBS knows what is the client search here Security.
The two large banks Swiss the UBS and Credit Suisse in some time has desplazado the idea of great bank blessing or the have betrayed as this is president of a small bank private blessing.
prefers not read his name in the newspaper the end and the carried ago as all the bankers Swiss also with the business of two large banks.
The UBS is the fact too large this mainly in the banca the investment where the Continental have won ground.
There the Swiss not resulted nothing more to say.
&apos; And is the mass during a time to the grip the Continental &apos;.
Indeed fact the UBS changed the banca the investment Anglo-Saxon handed his first great benefits and then wine the disaster none entity financial European had lost therefore money in the jungla of high risk as the great bank blessing.
The October the , the disaster was obvious.
&apos; scheme Wednesday the coalition officials of small country of seven million decided to greater operation of rescue in the history of their nation &apos; says the author Lukas Hässig in its book &apos; Spiegel UBS-Crash &apos; The crash the UBS &apos; in Spanish ..
The politicians Kyrgyzstan until thousands of millions of FRF or approximately thousands of millions of euros for save the great bank of the bancarrota.
How is they happens.
They talks with the bankers Swiss case Supposing the problem in the dimension of the UBS.
In June the , two of the three large banks Swiss is fusionan in a poderoso consortium.
Surge a bank that because the merger was too large for the small Switzerland and still growing.
For what is served for the two differing banks precursors the UBS is complementaran a bank wealthy but asleep with the centre of the administration of goods in Zurich and a internacionalización more poor but more strong.
Indeed suddenly the banks of investment internacionalizados arrived in function swift with a money with the that could do rodar a great bicycle financial.
There two names questions with this efficiently the UBS Peter Wuffli head of consortium the UBS the to and Marcel Ospel , then president of advice administrative.
&apos; always thought that Wuffli and Ospel were a team perfect &apos; says the expert in banca Hans Geiger.
&apos; Wuffli the intellectual modest that meant a the models and statistics and Ospel the intuitivo that he Greece step since the development in the bank until the summit &apos;.
Finally Ospel is fió the Wuffli.
And the end Wuffli cleared probably a mistake decisive &apos; Pensó that their models were a reality &apos; says Geiger.
&apos; It a case tragic &apos;.
Trágico perhaps.
Has clear The desatino arrived before the case.
The employees of the UBS is outlined clearly the rules meetings in superiors in the that Wuffli the head of consortium always repetía the same motto Bajar of Big to sink Sachs.

Some steps him consequently well.

And also like other banks arrangement the bajada during a time.
&apos; In summer the as the market estate American was in llamas the UBS compró there &apos; said Geiger , expert in banca.
Only large the euphoria so conducting the fall.
A workforce had to technician already the attempt to arrange occasion more complicated the what is hoped.
The jobs in the UBS is separate in seats proyectables and are inseguros until the date.
Currently cast aimed a great bank has a work almost impossible.
must find a strategy for a bank foremost the that all the models the business lógicos Purely stumbling.
Geiger expert in banks has a idea put end to the banca the investment focus on the administration of goods returning to the roots suizas.

Many the matters are close to privaciones and the adorned with what is there.

&apos; Are to continue fighting against the army in this issue until the reform are occurs &apos; says.
&apos; Or until the us muramos what is expected First.
The walls have eyes How the researchers you are currently in Facebook.
Before the norm in the new pack the extreme right-wing in Europe Anders Behring Breivik was simply another type is aireaba their points of view anti-inmigración in line.
The Monday Breivik cast befriended ought conducted a 22nd in Norway in July that showed dead is Baader-Meinhof to their first hearing judiciary public.
Meanwhile Breivik can have acted only was taken the be only in the ciberespacio bombarded past the main part of time to concertation to their attack cope to their computer charlando with some of the millions of nationalists that does the groups of right-wing in networks social.
After the tragedy of this summer the researchers wanted know more onset of these people.
But So how encontrarlas.
Fácil only future that possible in Facebook.
&apos; We brief account of the not was very difficult reaching to them &apos; says Jamie Bartlett author main the one report published recently on the populism digital European for the centre of studies British DEMOS.
The alijo the information personal the Facebook is that enciclopédico says Bartlett that the researchers could simply use the tool of advertising for determining their characteristics demográficas deseadas with a precise scientific the function that the imbalance have state reported during years.
The team of Bartlett reconstruct half million of fan of the groups of right-wing in all Europe and then they dirigieron announcements but in place in vincularles to a new broadband or product of dieta the announcements invitaban to the users to get a survey that Surprised on its level educational attitudes towards the violence and the optimism on its own future.
At reaching to via the Facebook Bartlett and their colleagues were Surely the observer to more of followers of parties to extreme right-wing in countries Europeans everything without escape the office.
&apos; It a way completely new the do a research &apos; says Bartlett.
Some the results not the of all surprising The supporters in line of the groups of right-wing tend to be young men and enfadados for the immigration.
However in a sort of issuing &apos; Especially that combined his activismo in line with the activismo outside the online are more reasonable more and less violent that Especially that is on behind the screen of computer &apos;.
The work of DEMOS is only a example of how Facebook is becoming in a new and important tool in hands of the scientists.
Centros the research researchers doctors and scientists politicians are reported the website for observer everything since problems of health to trends social stand as is consent in the &apos; I like &apos; messages in the walls and regular the state.
With more of millions of users assets agregando a average of three parts of content the day the &apos; supernova the data &apos; the Facebook is certainly a booming the research pushing the number of jobs academic with the name of siege in the title until almost a % in the past five years.
For some researchers the beauty the Facebook is that you allows observer to the people to the that not podías acercarte with a carpeta in the streets.
&apos; Before when intentabas encuestar to people of Party National British was very difficult identificarlos &apos;.
&apos; Tendrías that go to via the party and them never you nearly the access &apos; says Bartlett.
&apos; Facebook UEN everything that TV to them directly &apos;.
Other say that the website could providing a function of identify and address the problems of salud-social.
A study recent conducted by the doctora Megan Moreno the University the Wisconsin-Madison and their colleagues reconstruct that the students academics that Haifa the their hazañas the borrachera in Facebook ones a risk significantly greater the having problems with the drinks that the students to refused to silence on the issue.
Moreno suggests that the colleagues the students such as the region residenciales could control the website and intervene for help to a student that studies many dialogues the state with their Binge.
&apos; not portray treat a problem if not what portray diagnosticar &apos; said Apollinaire Christakis the co-autor the Moreno and director of Centre the Health Comportamiento and Development of Niño in the Institute the Research Infantil the Seattle said the Washington Post.
&apos; have met a function of identify children in danger that the other Similarly not turn diagnosticados &apos;.
Facebook also is constantly &apos; pinchando &apos; to their own population for obtain data.
The A-Team the Data of siege has yet statistics on the state of the relationship and the Day the St ribbons the expectation the participation electoral to half of period legislative the , and a index of Felicidad National mainly reported the information to the that is can access defenders of the freedom digital ago a time to maintain that the website should put to readiness to other your great amount of data for the research ..
However the users of Facebook know that the website them is we them like or not the sacrificio for power play the Scrabble with a friend to thousands of kilometres of distance is allowing that the website mine your information personal.
But what happened when the users of Facebook spend to fortunate part of a survey that or even local.
Meanwhile that the researchers have guidelines well Advocate on how picking their data outside the online in line is a barra free to all.
&apos; not believe that many of the users Europe trans-Atlantic even in the fact the that a researchers could be examined their profiles &apos; says Voyager Selwyn a sociologist of Laboratorio the Conocimiento the London on a study of the subsequently to all with the walls public to Facebook the students.
&apos; In what is to them precise was only between them and their friends &apos;.
Then is the issue of the methodology.
Even outside the online not there guarantee of the one issue of research this remains completely honest.
In Facebook is impossible know that part of the information the profile of a user and the messages of wall are truth.
&apos; applies to dices in Facebook and we that can outside the Facebook are two things completely different &apos; says Selwyn.
It for this is to despite the their years as researchers of the technology Selwyn believes that a sujetapapeles and a bolígrafo continuing remains the best tools to research that nobody can use.
&apos; not there substitute for specific in the world real and to have the people real &apos; says.
&apos; The research social is it is a particularly what social and a lot of this social still happening outside the online &apos;.
&apos; Frío and inhuman Anders Behring Breivik ago his first emergence public in the court.
Anders Behring Breivik the man to confesó be the brain the two attacks that prime to people in Norway this summer is the dilemma to itself same as a combatiente the &apos; resistance &apos; during their first emergence public in the court of Oslo.
&apos; am a commander military in the movement of resistance Norwegian and in the Gentlemen Templarios the Norway &apos; said foremost a clear full with people.
&apos; I opposed to court already the received the mandate to the organisations that does the strategy of hatred and because supports the multiculturalismo &apos;.
&apos; recognise the facts but not me declaro guilty &apos;.
The judge Torkjel Nesheim halted to Breivik during that monólogo because &apos; not willing give to Breivik the opportunity to use this hearing as a platform for the exprese their points of view &apos;.
For the same right is refused to allow the Breivik that promoted a speech writing with diagnosed address the family the their victims the end of the hearing.
Nesheim also thirteen to the police maintain the Breivik under custody during weeks more him teacher the access to the media the communication during four weeks and said that the authorities sooner that have a strict control on all the visits and the correspondencia during eight weeks.
Approximately the practical and family the rules victims petition to the hearing.
Some dressed with the hope of indifferently to Breivik to the eyes other to confirm that is position recluido under key.
all petition with the aim of important towards the conclusion.
&apos; nonetheless the seemed cold and inhuman &apos; said a superviviente the Utoya to the substantive ​ noruega NRK.
&apos; was embarrassed but for me was a step forward later the see and hear the suspect &apos;.
Vestido with a suit dark and shirt blue Breivik is remained calmado and professional to what long-term the hearing and miró to the journalists and to the practical to the eyes when entered and went of building.
To despite the strange notion of Breivik the be part of a movement of &apos; resistance &apos; greater the judge determinó that not a ill mental and said that not there tests the that overtaken with cómplices.
It possible to the some them consuele that the attacks of the July unimaginable be masterpiece the one extremista in place in a group of radical.
But that not suaviza automatically the pain and the confusion that all a nation still feel.
&apos; I like to prompt a monster but not what seems &apos; said a family the one victim.
&apos; would much more easy if we prompt &apos;.
Lecciones the interview delayed the Steve Jobs is keen in a battle this week.
After the death of Steve Jobs the October was some to what compararon with Henry Ford distinguiendo the bottle the technology as the Great Inventor Moderno.
But what is the fan of Apple could find more demonstrates in a interview to Jobs recently redescubierta to the that is the desempolvado as advances in a series of proyecciones special in the elderly markets this week is long fairness this aspiration creativa onset of the processes commercial and flows the work of the products.
was without doubt a leather soñador and hippie autorreconocido but also was a inflated meticuloso and a yonki the diagramas the flow a man to creía that many executive sufrían &apos; a disease that prevent the thinking that a great idea is the for cent of work &#91; but there is enormous amount of work between a great idea and a great product &apos;.
In clocked Cringely was realised the series of television chosen Triumph European the Nerds The triunfo the idiotas on the albores of computer personal , and is beside during more of a hour with Jobs for a wide and rarely conversation.
In that time had past barely years since the Jobs had been obliged to leave the Apple and already Couso reality in its new company meticulous NeXT waiting the adoption popular the internet.
Meanwhile that a small part of the interview the Cringely is oath-taking in Nerds said that the original the interview dissolved during their transport.

This material the archive slightly reeditado is the basis of Steve Jobs The interview delayed the minutes that at the cines Landmark this Wednesday and Thursday.
For someone known for odiar the interviews in depth Jobs here seems surprisingly ready to just their infinite tecnológicas and strategies commercial.
And very pensativo.
In four points different to what long-term the interview there large silencios between the questions and the answers to the seconds the reflexiones where Jobs is sopesando clearly their thoughts for precise.
also there moment in the that the perfeccionismo the Jobs its to the surface where seems impaciente due to the questions of Cringely empujándole to go more quickly towards the subjects or arguments the main importance.

&apos; To what long-term the years in the business I always Surprised &apos; For what can things &apos; and the answers that you babies the way invariable are &apos; Oh that is only the function as is ago &apos;.
Nobody knows for what ago what is ago in the business nobody thinks in the things very deeply.
That is what is walking.
Jobs brings the detail their efforts to simplify the accounting the Apple.
Desconcertado for the way in being registraban the costs to often starting with a &apos; cost standard &apos; that is at the eye to good cubero and the most is line with a &apos; finds &apos; developed a factory automatizada that aseguraba that could determine the costs commercial the detail.
Above the joke the Pope.
Jobs narra the &apos; cash Blue &apos; that him same built with Steve Wozniak a recording that she is the people hackear cautious the company telephone and do law to long distance free.
They has writing widely onset of recording but the euphoria the Jobs here to proceed to cash Blue as a act of empoderamiento is contagioso.
Describe how him and Wozniak probaron the cash prohibited the use of a telephone public doing a so-called and then conectándose since a network of AT &amp; T to another while creaba a bucle with the main amount of satellite possible.
&apos; right envolviendo the things around the world is average dozen the times and gritabas to via the telephone public and readjust a minute more afternoon the telephone public to the door of the hand &apos; says Jobs with a risita.
&apos; vintage young and we that aprendimos was the unexpected build something we ourselves to could control thousands of millions of dollars in infrastructure in all the world &apos;.
We two not satisfaction much but composure build a thing small that could control a thing .Latin was a lesson incredible and not believe that never liked Therefore Apple without her.
Jobs continues describiendo a joke gloriosa that him and Wozniak almost wayside llamando the Vatican to via the cash Blue in half of the night and regulating talk to the Pope while at their best imitation of Henry Kissinger.
To measure that several Member the hierarchy Catholic were convocados in half of the night for talk to the diplomatic US the two estallaron in carcajadas fair before the that the mismísimo Pope outside reawakened for go to answer the telephone.
Above enamorarse the technology and the sale for telephone with Philips Hewlett :.
To the age of years to the hunting the so-called the spare for build a contador the often arrangement to Philips Hewlett in the guide telephone and you did a so-called.
Little later the his conversation telephone the minutes Jobs managed a employment of summer to time part-time in Hewlett-Packard.
&apos; That was a remarkable influence on me was the only company that in seen to this age and formed my vision of this is was a company and we well that trataban to their employees &apos;.
Jobs is became later in one of the employees of HP that dispatching the laboratories the research the company in Palo High where when &apos; the first computer the table never done &apos;.
was so large as a GDR had a small screen the tubo catódico and me enamoré the him.
Conseguiría a journey until HP as adolescent and perdería the time to this machine and escribiría programmes for her.

Mucho before the that liderara the revival of Apple Jobs proféticamente foresaw the way in the many leaders of the industry tropezarían in its vision and perderían the control of their quota the market.
&apos; Di that trabajas in IBM or Xerox for this is hardly fotocopiadoras and impresoras best So and what &apos;.
You has the monopoly of the quota the market for this is the company not has more success.
The departments of sales and marketing increases the success for this is the this class of people the that when we directing the companies and the people peacekeepers the products are expulsadas of forum for the decision-making the decisions.
The bottle the products that subsequently to this position of monopoly is pudre for fault of people to do have the notion of good products vs abuse products the knowledge of profession necessary.
That is what is Commissioneru'\u2019s in Xerox.

Scalia and Greek cenan with the rival the law of assistance health while the court accepts the case.
The day to the Court Housel is Egyptian to door doors to examine the issue politically controversial the if aceptarían the challenge to the law of assistance health of president Obama two of their magistrates Antonin Scalia and Clarence Greek were agasajados in a dinner patrocinada for the signing of lawyers to expondrá the case foremost the high court.
The occasion was the past Thursday when the nine judges is gathered in a hearing preliminary for observer blueprint the petitions the review.
One the cases in question was a demand tabled by states desafiando the reform total of the assistance health Gibraltar for the Congress the year past a law is the been a prisoner the war to the activists Conservatives in all the country.
The magistrates acordaron admit to exercise the demand and the fact is expected a need historic the hours and average for March and the result probably enturbiará still more the career presidential the , that summit in full changing in the moment in the decision of court is No.
The lawyer that comparecerá foremost the court and alegará that the law must be desechada be probably Paul Clement cast constructive as fiscal general the euro during the government of better W. Bush.
The signing of lawyers the Clement Bancroft PLLC was a the rules almost two dozens of companies that ayudaron to patrocinar the dinner annual the society Federalista a group that has many years dedicated to the defence of the principles legal Conservatives.
Another signing that patrocinó the dinner Jones Day represents to a the rules associations commercial that desafió the law is Federation National the Negocios Experts.
Another patrocinador was the giant farmacéutico Pfizer Inc , that is a huge interest financial in the result of dispute.
The dinner is launched in a hotel the Washington hours later the hearing preliminary of court on the case.
Among the assistants was between other Mitch McConnell the republicano more important in the Senate and a Maracaibo declared the law of assistance health.
The guests special in the dinner Scalia and Greek.
not is nothing new The two judges have state factual to events of the society Federalista during years.
And not a something that between the conflict with the rules ethical.
Indeed fact the judges are exentos of Licence the Conducta that applied to actions of the magistrates federal ashamed.
If not what finally could say that caerían under the Licence Canon 4C that says &apos; A judge can attend to events for custom funds to organisations Spectrum-related with the law and other although the judge not be a speaker a Vladimir the honour or record in the programme the stand event &apos;.
However the proximidad absolute the Scalia and Greek to two of the bufetes the lawyers in the case it as to a company with a huge interest financial was enough to alarmar to the activists the ethics in the government.
&apos; This impressive healed the ethics and fighters towards the code goes in against the rules demands of several magistrates that the court for the same rules that is usual to all the judges federal &apos; said clocked Morin the president of Common Cause Causa Position ..
&apos; The judges were agasajados in a desperate the funds to wined with lawyers to have cases outstanding foremost the court &apos;.
Their emergence and assistance in the revenues the funds for this event undermines any demand the impartiality and is unacceptable.
Scalia and Greek have shown little interest for the criticism that they to mezclan too easily the activity of court with the agenda impulsada for groups as the society Federalista.
And the wife of Greek Ginni is a researcher encountered conservative.
For another part the conservative argue that is the magistrada Shcharansky Kagan the that is a problem Ethical not Scalia and Greek.
Kagan worked as procuradora general the administration Obama when are some are on challenges legal to the law in the court of first ultimately.
Their critical have preferred to the Kagan is appealing to see the case fights that was too involucrada in defend the law as for now be neutral.
Kagan not been prioritised none indication of the what demands to do.

Serios avisos of Pentagon onset of the potential cuts in defence.
The secretary of defence Ricardo Panetta calentó the Congress the Monday advirtiendo that the cuts banknote the budget is being avecinan could agro-industry the safety national and provoke a response financial in chain since the corridors of Pentagon to the camps of battle the Afghanistan to the chains the montaje civilians.
The Pentagon already is digiriendo the thousand million of dollars to tries to what long-term the next 1950s but now afraid a reduction additional the thousand million or more in cuts that can be spelling if the Congress not manages reaching to a agreement on the expenditure.
&apos; The impact of these cuts would devastating for the department &apos; said Panetta in a letter to the senadores John McCain republicano for years and Lindsey Graham republicano for Carolina of South.
She that the failure of Congress for reaching to a agreement on the budget and their consequence the so-called &apos; hostages &apos; Choice place to a for cent of tries global and a high to many projects new.
&apos; A correspondingly so large applied to this meant indiscriminada newspapers that the main part of our projects sonars and the construction not been Public enforce not been can buy three cuartas parties to a ship or a building and clean seriously other efforts to modernisation &apos; wrote Panetta to the senadores.
&apos; also us veríamos forced to apartar to many of our officials civilians the way involuntaria and because the that the reduction is impondría with such quickly is almost safe to solve the licenciar civilians with the end of honour the aim &apos;.
&apos; These changes romperían the faith with Especially that Other our army and dañarían seriously the good readiness &apos;.
The cuts with the time alcanzarían to the troops the combat said Panetta.
&apos; If well the funding for times the war in the accounts in Operaciones the contingencia in overseas not been sees directly affected by the hostages the efforts to the war is confirmed affected adversely by the serious disruptive in the budgets of basis &apos; warned Panetta.
&apos; The procurement the staff are reduciría what is removed to delays in the contracts and the supervision of contract the supports the war &apos;.
&apos; The personal in nómina is reduciría turning place to delays in the payments to the suppliers in time to war and the support legal and political would cut &apos;.
The two senadores previously writing to Panetta ago days asking information on the possible impact of the cuts banknote in the Department the protection.
&apos; The consequence of a hostages in the Department the protection inevitably a rapid decline in the States United as main power military of world &apos;.
&apos; We definite in against the this action draconiana &apos; said the senadores in a communiqué whole of afternoon the Monday when publicaron the letter of Panetta.
&apos; This not a result of the that is can live and lag not a one that overall Agenda to us ourselves &apos;.
&apos; The hostages is a threat to the interests of the safety national the States United and not been must allowing that occurring &apos;.
If the letter of Panetta and the latest warnings the senadores consequence the pressure to a compromise budgetary or scrupulously the law for eximir the Pentagon the cuts is why see.
Panetta has been each time more frank on the potential cuts to despite the that came to a work in the top of Pentagon with years of experience in budgets in the Congress and the White and sabiendo that is enfrentaba to decisions difficult.

&apos; It a ship without sailors &apos;.
&apos; It a Assault without balas &apos;.
&apos; It a arrived airline without enough anonymity firepower &apos;.
&apos; It a tiger the role a army the cuarteles buildings and bombs without enough soldiers image for comply the mission &apos; said Panetta in their words of openness in the Pentagon.
&apos; It a rather that suffering the lowest moral the preparation inadequate and not a capable of extra the day with the potential adversaries &apos;.
&apos; In effect taught to the aggression &apos;.
In a apéndice to their letters to McCain and Graham Panetta enuncia new details of how the tries &apos; generan important risks operational delay in the time to answer to the crisis conflicts and disasters limited severamente our capacity of be removed and fighting advance in all the world and it a risk unacceptable in future operations the combat &apos;.
And Panetta said that some of the elderly projects of defence could manage the hacha including Especially that already been are probando and some only in the first stages of the planning.

Thank for tall to our side to via the all these years.
We three-and-a-half almost years reaching to Côte Rica thanks for having a therefore and lamentamos that we did that therefore time in fact until there.
frozen People even already been refers to their viewers as the programmes more large of year.
Le adds that a little to pressure to their visit.
Some the shows more large that we tocado during the past years sucedieron during the last couple of weeks.
Tocamos a couple of shows gigantescos in Sao Paulo and to the this we did project in manner for this viewers in Côte Rica.
Indeed truth are very desperately the concern Hence.
Amamos that country us love surfear and the jungla for both things Côte Rica is between the best of world.
How was the abused Côte Rica and their Ecumenical for surfear.
We many friends to the surfeadores and have a great friend that lives in Tamarindo and the doldrums Hence are beyond.
My friends always been convicted to surfear to Côte Rica and Nicaragua together with Mexico are large places for surfear case was how we enteramos for half of people to loves the surf.

Intentaremos give the best shows possible to a good variety of songs trataremos the concern a couple of songs the individual album and you to our fan a good and testing repertorio.
You never echo the repertorio.
To what is how this.
believe that is partially because have nine disks and we touch more of songs and to each one him Black-and-white different songs case that is difficult decisions revels songs touch each night.
When have two or three songs in the repertorio that for pink the not touch that we debated enfocados and also us keeps surprised because we reminds the reasons for the that we gustaban matters songs and the are we could have neglected.
That ago that the programmes make more interesting to us and for both believe that also what again more interesting to the people.
With this entire are &apos;clock years of personal.
At indifferently dating So is difficult to believing everything we that have achieved.
Yes absolutely.
In first place believe that none of us is 900 that we in a great broadband the diplomat and have done by more of years ago that might as a dream.
Do illustration our bendiciones and we emociona much to host continue doing music together.
all us to and we love create music.
are lucky the area to places of world to the that always quisimos go.
The things not could be better for us.
What meant to you the ought been part fundamental of declaration of grunge.
always has been a honour be part of this group of great gangs.
are very friends of the people of Soundgarden Mudhoney and Alice on-site Chains.
It surprising when a movement arises of a group of friends and is something little common.
Indeed increasingly in when arises a broadband the one city but it a more strange when five or ten gangs happily the same time to a same city.
We proud and honest the be part of group of Seattle.
still tocamos with some of them to time in when.
The year past fought in a festival with Alice on-site Chains and fought in Canada with Mudhoney saw to Soundgarden in its novel case that are lucky the be friends of all them still and we honour be part of this technician the Seattle that emerged.
also is very strange that a broadband as the you are keen united and with the ourselves Member for both time.
Yes four the us have we together for years and Matt Cameron is our joined ago years we opened for itself only a great more time of the removal many gangs.
In first place believe that all of lucky the be still with life and in second all we preaching for the others.
all are friends very closest and thank to this also been the open avenidas music that you babies freedom to each one of buying.
We enjoys the few to the other with the music the individual each and not could be better.
The relationship of you to the word reputation not been made simpler without however thanks to their success have shown do what is organize.
How lie a balance.
To as we all evolving has been more easy find a balance.
We attending the that not be too the entire because it easier fall in this game of the large multitudes and the people to loves your music.
Meanwhile each democrat that the people is there for the music that you democrat that misjudgement respect the music and we that the assassins without encapricharse for a famous and that a rock star something that the moment the us really him interested.
How reminds his another project Mother Love Bone.
believe that escribimos very good songs and the principle was something Preparations.
Treaty a broadband for almost three years and never tracing a disco until the next the that muriera Andy Symeou Woods ..
was many frustraciones because durara therefore and we more important is that there are very friends of Bruce Fairweather and Greg Gilmore that detected in the broadband with us and when hear a song or see a photograph thinking in the incredible person to Andy was and how me was speaking always was a happy go to work reírnos , talk of music and futbol and a more.
was a be human surprising and we extrañamos.
The broadband national The Robertas be the charge of opening the programmes in Côte Rica.
It true that you local his work in special Eddie Vedder and the for this is escogieron for the opening.
Yes the production us sent videos with several proposals and that was the broadband that more we that it is our desperately the see what is The Robertas can offer in alive and duty be very &apos;.
For what always editorial the letter of Yellow Ledbetter in alive.
constantly is a question to Ed Eddie Vedder , case that not know.
dear the singing and that the what ago with what First that is you occurring.
As bajista revels are their impartiality.
are so.
Soon the first to being me occur are Geezer Butler John Entwistle contracted A4-0552 Ramone John Doe Paul McCartney Chuck Dukowski.
are many that could speak across the late on the bajistas that you crazy.
How has achieved Pearl Jam maintain relevant the grunge to despite the not be already a fashionable.
believe that all we always us devices a little desconectados the word grunge.
When thinking in her me reminds the gangs that you before as Mudhoney Soundgarden Nirvana and all the that early to same time and if there colossal now that the is something marvellous because it music that purpose the worth listen and gangs as Mudhoney are doing now best music that never.
At principle his music had a content more dark and now been has journey more positive.
To what is how this change.
It interesting because that the there a couple of songs in the new album that perhaps increasingly unimaginable more livianas but also there songs as chosen End or Just Breathe that meddles as songs very shameful although can sound a little Positive.
With sides when Ed me to tocó lloré when the hacking and are songs deeply shameful.
believe that when creces and there somewhere trauma in your life and is lose to a family or a friend matters things begin to draw your art and your music and those two songs without doubt represent that is me.
also believe that is can be a person happy and even so power do music that make brown-skinned.

Parque or mountain.
The architects implementing the opportunity to the competition more beyond the controversial on refunded.
The Contest municipal on the doors reabre the debate on the role of Collserola in Barcelona.
Amediados the , in full changing the already extinta Corporación Metropolitana the Barcelona CMB , this Administration imprimió few pasquines the promotion of Collserola.
The folleto definía the mountain as the great park the Barcelona heavy.
It more are acompañaba the one comparison in figures with the Central Park neoyorquino.
With the death of the CMB in the volume returned to situarse in the imaginary the many as the limit higher the Barcelona , remains the capital catalana the rules few that not been orientan in the gravity north-south but upwards mountain -abajo sea ..
The rating of Collserola as park natural widest in this idea.
The reference already not was Central Park but Yellowstone with the jabalís in the role of oso Yogi.
In these are was until the in September the mayor convocó a megacompetición states for competition for other so doors of access to Collserola.
A door liberalisation to the idea of traffic without doubt.

It almost already a subject recurrent the that spoil momentum when two Member the this former untouchables the elected is recognised in a lift.
And this fact five-minute ordinary precisely to a the rules few coincidencias between what is also three architects barceloneses and teachers university to being have tabled.
Miguel Roldán Daniel Mòdol and Marta Bayona the tender is fit.
For Roldán after addressed the face shallow &apos; is ago necessary &apos; discuss on &apos; the face of mountains &apos; across increasingly that the speech the Ildefons Cerdà the rules cultivation devote not been has a to all.
&apos; Is onwards the basis of the volume more eels the Barcelona is the seaside.
Among other things by their great accesibilidad.
Collserola is more complex &apos; judgment the architect for who is title of &apos; doors of Collserola &apos; within a &apos; trap léxica &apos; not there is thinking in them &apos; as the accesos to a volume but the delimitación the should areas where there is act &apos;.
Mòdol as Roldán and Bayona with experience in the world urbanístico status of proposal to &apos; challenge intellectual &apos; with &apos; some dangers &apos;.
Peligros derivatives the what &apos; uncertain that is today day project the space public &apos; after the experience vivida in the and the had the area of Fòrum &apos; his low-key of cisne &apos;.
The first fear is the own delimitación the should borders on from being can build.
&apos; Limiting something is implement already the next step &apos; is say his sobrepaso.
&apos; There that thinking in new instruments urbanísticos the planning because the current in reference to Plan General Metropolitano PGM &#93; can give ordinary to auténticos disasters &apos;.
Over ceñido to the question Mòdol his that simplificando the funerals vallesana the Collserola &apos; can understood as a volume the Barcelona not &apos; for a question assures topográfica.
Mòdol reminds that already exist a work done by the Patronat the Collserola that &apos; not be self-explanatory in lump socially &apos; although thanks to opportunity to the mayor provides to their gremio the intervene in this project &apos; since the first time &apos;.
And still more pastu'\u2019, that the cercanía the mountain with the city is the pass that allows to the architects specific in the debate but &apos; doubt &apos; on whether it this profile technical the that must chair the equipment multidisciplinarios &apos; everything a identifies &apos; urgency to being have been the create &apos; The architects should be only a tool &apos;.
Bayona catalogue that the answer to the question is room title to this important is complex because the rules of the tender lack a vision global the Collserola &apos; They have blessing notice Also -dice- in the sense montaña-mar but not exist a reading longitudinal that anywhere and understands the area in its whole &apos;.
of causing the least in its case that very chosen for participate in the competition.

The patrón the dispersión the leftovers of the aeronave Youth resorted to the grant was impactó in the ground in conditions of integrity structural.
not is the Previous obvious the ceasefire or explosion.
In the website of Behaviour continuing without revelarse evidencias in the leftovers of the nave the somewhere type of explosion or firearms.
The recent results of the research indicate that could have been multiple contacts with the ground.
During the work of camp is the met parts of the aeronave to a raising the thousand feet on the level half of sea the ground where a outstanding that goes since the seven degrees until degrees of gradient.
The photographs keen to sequence in the that expected is desarticuló to what long-term the point pack.
The information underground elements that these seem to the grant could have been multiple impactos in the ground.
After the search cleared in a zone more wider that the website acordonado around the accident not been the met parts pieces of the aeronave what is strengthens the presumption of the impact is presented in conditions of integrity structural.
MSS inter-institutional protocol for the gene the obesity.
Dirige the certain Social a research for compromising the gene the obesity in children and young is supported in specialists of IPN.
The Institute participate of certain Social IMSS announced that aimed a research for compromising the gene the obesity in children and young so-called protocol la Genética the obesity the childhood and the adolescence la that possible count with marcadores associated the obesity.
In a communiqué the head of the Unit the Research Médica in Bioquímica of smoke-related the Especialidades of Centre Médico National Siglo 21st Miguel Cross Valverde mover that is in-house a team multidisciplinario the doctors nurses nutriólogos and definite social.
words team is supported by specialists and pupils the postgrado of Institute National the Health Public INSP and the Centre the Research and the lawmaking Avanzados Cinvestav of Institute Politécnico National IPN ..
In the research is taught to participate to the population make or not derechohabiente negotiating to the units sporting participants of IMSS in the Valle the Mexico where is . to all the tests to the age all the lottery to onwards the rules : hours.
Destacó that the protocol started in the Unit Deportiva Cuauhtémoc State the Mexico Poniente and the since the October the activity is brings to all the Unit Deportiva Nezahualcóyolt State the Mexico Middle ..
A increasingly that is Valencian the aim of towards the or minors the study Unions in the Unit Deportiva Independence southern of Cuahutémoc Federal and finally in the Unit Deportiva Morelos the north of Cuahutémoc Federal ..
Explicó that the purpose of this research is aware the components and the importance of the Genetic with regard to development of the obesity and identify in children and young Mexican factors the risk for preventing the emergence of diseases chronic degenerativas.
At apart this the November the Day World the Diabetes precisó that the aim is towards the three thousand children and young between six and years of age with the consent and supervision of their parents to the implementation of cuestionarios specific on food.
also is they preguntará on the activity physical and much heredofamiliares the diseases with the purpose of avoid factors the risk that desencadenen padecimientos as diabetes or end-stage renal.
Detalló that the lottery is they applies to all the participants measurements antropométricas weight stature circumference the cintura decision-making the pressure gauges determination of the levels of glucosa triglicéridos , colesterol and insulin and genetic is search identify genes that is asocien to the obesity infant ..
Cross Valverde pointed that this research temper to the concern the professionals of the health by the alarming increase the weight in the age.
la The polls the health of and signal that the very only six years was a commission in the case of the children of for cent in obesity and the rules girls of for cent in terms of obesity also been observed a ascent dramatic la upgrading the specialist of IMSS.
Indicó that the justification for the search of the marcadores is sustenta in the population of country differ the other for their history Genetic.
informed that the average the Mexican has for cent of inheritance Indian American 30 for cent European and five for cent wage and this condition are reflects the genes that is certain to diabetes and less the weight.
Explicó that the function general the Genetic the obesity is translates in the inability to Limiting the procedure to energy is consumimos lowcalorie and the are stored in manner of blubber.
The researchers mover that the benefit direct for the participants is the evaluation all-embracing the children what is allows detect if similar somewhere rise to obesity or obesity.
Even said the presence of pliegues the colour obscuro acantosis in bottleneck and antebrazo that subject to have the that padezca alteraciones metabólicas and until prediabetes.
The information is bikers the way confidential the doctors the entregan for writing to the parents to those are they explains each a the rules measurements and the changes in the lifestyle of life is in perform for preventing diseases.
Cross Valverde mover that there three components main that cause obesity and other padecimientos crónicos the sedentarismo that is the lack of activity physical daily tall the main part of day upper cope the television and use media the transport in place in walking distances short-haul.
also is how to the temperatures ingesta calórica is say the main consumption of alcohol azucaradas the carbohidratos tamales bread pizza hamburger etc with high content in unprocessed and pork and the Genetic that is analysing in this protocol.
Asfalto the UNAM evitaría bumpy.
Raphael Herrera researchers of the Tatiana the Química the UNAM develops asfaltos modified with polímeros for produce a mixture with better risk regardless of the conditions environmental and the temperature.
If the signs that sending the pavimento surely civilisation not be necessary reparar closely the thousand bumpy each season the dry in the Zona Metropolitana of Valle the Mexico warned Raphael Herrera Nájera researchers of the Tatiana the Química FQ the UNAM cast assured that if the process of construction and peacekeeping the one pavimento asfáltico is the adequate the pretty could radioactivity in amount or even disposed for completely.
In his conference A opinion technological the pretty dictada in the framework of Year International the Química only to fortunate that the laboratory to their office develops asfaltos modified with polímeros for produce a mixture with characteristics insignificant to the of asphalt but with a greater resistance mechanics therefore to highest as to lowest temperatures.
Herrera Nájera estimó that this type of asfaltos modified could perhaps the places where the climate is extremely hot as a cities of northern of country to improve their lives and for this therefore the training of pretty.
Explicó that the asphalt the part more disproportionately of oil is a whole of moléculas the hidrocarburos should the high weight molecular law asfaltenos and other the lower weight molecular law maltenos that EMIs him babies the pavimento his readiness behaviour viscoelástico.
The behaviour viscoelástico of asphalt prevent the that the highest temperatures closely the degrees is practically as a Liquid-fuel to degrees Celsius his viscosidad is very high-speed and to degrees Celsius where a state almost hardest while the to temperatures very lowest the asphalt is again quebradizo added.
applies previous mean that the rules streets the resistance of asphalt not a uniform but that is going added during the day of agreement with the conditions environmental and the temperature warned the specialist in engineering chemistry.
The researchers of the FQ observed that the streets of the City the Mexico in its majority are covered by pavimento flexible the opened was consists of six Rain the materials the rules subjects the last three involucran the asphalt.
Among the ground more superficiales is position to carpeta asfáltica conformada for small stones bañadas in asphalt and then compactadas.
Every a the rules piedritas that represents the carpeta pointed is bañada with asphalt.
At transitar the vehicles and generarse efforts unknown allows that the forces are distributing very well in the pavimento.
If is private the asphalt amended is difundirían still best issuer the engineering chemical.
Above the carpeta asfáltica abundó is placed a final layer so-called carpeta the rodadura the opened is benefit of a material the stone fine is say a bit that also been baña in asphalt.
As is about the layer that goes to be in contact with the llantas the vehicles must have more strength mechanics that the carpeta asfáltica and providing fricción in the road.
At be the part of pavimento that goes to receive and think the efforts to carpeta the rodadura required also have the thick adequate and is how responsibilities the material of the moment benefit.
The climate particularly the moisture and the compensatory the temperature also the one factor very important to considered in special the water said because affects considerably the risk of the carpeta asfáltica.
When the ground is humedece the water is disseminate in the internal the carpeta and is difficult to charters this macro-economic a reblandecimiento the all the ground the pavimento and for this therefore the training of pretty.
In the process of training of a bache said the first in desgastarse is the film the rodamiento and only then is affects the carpeta asfáltica but the damage not happens instantáneamente but that is a process that should atenderse to the first signs with suitable programmes in peacekeeping.
The also member of Senior National the Investigadores mover that the burden vehicular is another factor important in the training of pretty and for this is thick the individual a the rules Rain of pavimento must go always in relationship with the burden vehicular and ensure that is Valencian for avoid the are train bumpy frecuentemente.
Raphael Herrera warned that even there a that grips and work on the asphalt for example the emulsiones asfálticas that the other countries already been lie even in the market and Youth reparar the pretty with easily and without need to use highest temperatures.
What him wilfully to the candidate the Valle for a the new señorita Colombia.
Análisis the factors that incidieron for the Melina Ramírez Serna not alcanzara the maximum of Señorita Colombia.
The Valle receives his title number of recounted.
Indeed new the Valle of Cauca is still with the wish to the maximum of Señorita Colombia.
This increasingly Melina Ramírez Serna is had to shaping with be in the podio the ganadoras lucir the maximum of silver and the broadband that the acreditan as new recounted the Colombia.
With the result Resources anoche in Cartagena where the señorita Atlantic is alzó with the maximum and the cetro the department already sum titles the Princess and Melina is a to the legión the women vallecaucanas that have state closely the maximum but that were proclamas princesas between them Valdés Ospina Benoit 1947 , Clara Domínguez Borrero 1949 , Patricia Bellini Ayala 1979 , Longwy Álvarez 1981 , Rose Mary Alzate 1983 , Olga María Arenas 1987 , Leila Blanque 1988 , Mónica Evers 1989 , María Consuela Pinedo 1990 , Diana Isabel Romero 1993 , Giselle Garcés Aljure Frassoni , Catalina Giraldo preparing , Stephanie Garcés Aljure Opportunities ..
Today the great question is many is for a What wilfully.
Because the result represents the defeat the one great favorita that the individual presentation proved that her had everything to be the new Señorita Colombia not in vain was elected Reina the Police and better Rostro Jolie the Vogue titles that better reinas as Taliana Vargas or Natalia Navarro cast is big the maximum of Señorita Colombia.
The first factor is being viewed key in the decision to three-and-a-half the jury the designarla First Princess assurance in the not convenció with their response to the question &apos; What is that book that you has packaging to you and for what benefit for Martín Murillo Gómez the Carreta Literaria Leamos.
At interrrogante the vallecaucana replied.
&apos; read a believe quite in the literature believe that is a way of culturalizarse definitive believe that the book that you started to childhood is &apos; The principito &apos; is a book quite discontentment.
Currently leo &apos; Crimen and punishment &apos; is a book the literature universal that all we read and today in day am read the book the Irene Nemirovski a Russian a book hermosísimo that is way &apos; The ardor the blood &apos;.
A answer to little about First for the term &apos; culturalizarse &apos; and second for not explain the function concrete the what function each one of the books that citó the have packaging.
But the conclude the ceremony Melina manifested justly relaxed and happy with the result &apos; the universe is sabio passes what is has to happen.
And for all the people for favour lean a poquito &apos; The principito &apos; is a great book &apos;.
Among the hipótesis Voyager is says that the Valle the quemó the favoritismo.
A journalist bogotano insinuó that the be the theories the ovacionada and the candidate to being was all the prizes hypothetical challenge of gastronomía Oster vote of public for the best suit non-industrial and Reina inner-city &apos; that adherents the celos the rules other candidate , estresó to the cases and for this not brilló in the scene &apos;.
And that is notó in its first presentation in suit the bathing in the seaside of Hilton and their two desfiles in the memorable the coronación.
Although in two lució safe is notó that you missing the strength and the momentum that the representatives of Magdalena and Atlantic yes Valley.
Ariel Osorio journalist of programme &apos; As in house &apos; of Channel RCN issuer that the fact the that Melina outside abroad recounted &apos; checked to the candidate to more prizes earns during the tender not remains as dominated &apos;.
Moreover Valle is prepared to what Finally very esquiva with the press and there is equivocó.
Another hipótesis is that Valle not annexed convince the jury on its interest towards the work social that is in recent the essence of Concurso National the Belleza.
For something two days before the election the jury international Lucy Doughty manifested that them buscaban a woman comprometida with the requirements social the his pais.
&apos; The beauty speak not enough to a Miss Colombia there is indifferently stronger beyond the what physical and monitoring the his sensitivity social that before the imply the Concurso Purely already involucradas in projects &apos; mover.
also is especula that Valle pecó for their flaws in the derriere and the fibrosis that is you notaba in its abdomen but is planetary therefore precisely the jury the proposal as the candidate la Belleza natural la with the body more healthy good food and work physical responsible.
The preparador the reinas Borg Hernán Orozco recognises that Melina not had the best body that in best &apos; but its problem of fibrosis in the abdomen that the truth for my not was very notoria him nor points in the last day &apos;.
Among therefore the journalist Guido Hoyos the magazine Cromos viewed that the error the vallecaucana were the speeches quirúrgicas that is practicó.
&apos; The cirugías are well but Valle not been the rape do.
Their body never was his strong and here is the cobraron &apos;.
For this prize that we first time handing the Concurso National the Belleza later the parade in suit the bathing emerged a debilitating vaticinio that anoche is factors therefore is truthfully that this was the contentillo that Raymundo him concedía to Melina for not respect the taste of the maximum.
Realidad or not what true that the Melina since today starts a year the reinado not as sovereign but as recounted position to him offered to possibility of risk to Colombia in one of the certámenes international for designation of own Concurso National.
However her examined to the history as a the rules reinas that the despite the his arrollador step for Cartagena him was esquiva the maximum.
So was the work of caleño that lighthouse the cadáver the Alfonso Cano.
A lofoscopista the Cali Commissioneru'\u2019s to the history as the man to confirmed the death of &apos; Alfonso Cano &apos;.
The work of these officials is key.
The past of November a lofoscopista of CTI the Cali Commissioneru'\u2019s to the history as the man to confirmed the identity of maximum head of the Farc &apos; Alfonso Cano &apos; to via the cotejo the their fingerprints digital.
Indeed the seven lofoscopistas that laboran in the seccional of CTI that week him tocaba the Question the &apos; availability &apos; to Eliazar González a man of Rico Tejada that has been working in the area of research judiciary.
At begin his career González worked in municipalities of Chocó where many times had to internarse for more of five days in the jungle for reaching the website in the that were the bottom that ought be at.
In the are westwards to the capital of Valle and then the land the courses preparations are especializó in lofoscopia that is the study of the fur the fricción is say the rules palmas the rules hands and the ground.
The week the operational against alias Alfonso Cano to Eliazar him warned that 22nd clothes minimum for three days.
Something large him anticipated.
The Friday in the night went to the Cauca in a grant since Palmira.
Sabía that publishes identify two Basra and the are sospechaba that one of them was the man to Schuman to the guerrilla more former of world for this is you hoursu'\u2019sleep that 22nd the card decadactilar the psychologist Ricardo Sáenz his real name ..
However when arrived with the team of research the website in the that is bringing the cadáver not what Interinstitutional for their aspect physical therefore was very different to the president seen in the media the communication.
was without barba clothing as a fresh the area without glasses and a more five-year-old.
But the fingerprints not mienten.
Acompañado the one lupa galtoniana ink a transplantador and a linterna Eliazar comparó the tiny fingerprints of cadáver with the card.
Their eye not him falló was &apos; Alfonso Cano &apos;.
constantly same night the man oriundo the Rico Tejada was the mid-July the confirmarle the minister of defence Juan emperor Pinzón that yes is was the maximum head of the Farc.
In search of the left.
For a dactiloscopista the Sijín the Cali the recognition that was the president Juan Manuel Santos to Eliazar González in the wheel the press for the operational against &apos; Cano &apos; is very significant.
Many People not knows our work.
The dactiloscopia is a science accurate without margin of mistake to be expressed to be key in the resolution of crimes.
Apart the identification the bottom the lofoscopistas support investigations for crimes as hurto and Symeou and Chicago the identity of the people capturadas.
When is aliens many of similar cédulas wishful or not have entered.
We them somewhat the impression dactilar and the unfamiliarity in the basis of data.
The researchers counted that the one case of hurto him tocó validity a part of wall of a house therefore in this place the ethnicity had supported their momentum for cash a box strong full of joyas and money.
&apos; The walls are difficult because not the land apropiadas for cash a impression dactilar but in this case of obtaining the left the whole of labour and identify the criminal that in participated in different hurtos &apos; reminded.
The fingerprints also be the or reaffirm suspected in cases of charge.
ago little harvests to a man dead with bottles the licor to their around.
For half of the research is determinó that a family could be suspect the crime and indeed a deep in the bottleneck coincidía.
Although this not ensure that very been the murderer yes we ubica in the scene of crime.
A dactiloscopista of CTI mover that the items &apos; the fingerprints is sacan with reactivos chemical or physical &apos;.
When paper is used a transplantador or tape for levantarlas.
Then the this the tiny are flown to the Asif that is the basis of data delincuencial or to the Registraduría.
&apos; The problem is that there is many dead-end Criminalizing &apos; pursued the expert of CTI.
Aclaró that not all is as is shows in the programme the television CSI.
So as not all this is easy is gold not all this is being heart is again imprint.
However if can be usada if is initially the cotejo dynamic.
The &apos; indignados &apos; defy to authorities in New York.
Centenares the demonstrators is intimidatory foremost the square Zuccotti for acampar.
A great part atendió the agenda of desalojo and is westwards to a paruqe practicable.
The mentally of movement Ocupa Wall Journal desafiaron this Tuesday to the authorities of New York the treat the possible to new under the above-mentioned the one agenda judiciary to the square the Manhattan the where were desalojados the following and the treat the occupy another park the Great Manzana.
Centenares the demonstrators is intimidatory foremost the square Zuccotti where wanted access thanks to a agenda judiciary that allows to the &apos; indignados &apos; again to acampar in the place while the other hand the movement replied to desalojo remain a volume more the north of the city where the misunderstanding new arrests.
&apos; Our idea is that if the court not we allows again to acampar in the square us we are installing in some other place and continuaremos the battle legal for again to Zuccotti case as to via the tables and demonstrations peaceful &apos; said each of the speakers of movement &apos; Ocupa Wall Journal &apos; Mark Bray.
Bray detalló that the answer to the &apos; indignados &apos; the desalojo the his camp dictated personally for the mayor of New York Gahler Bloomberg arrived until the courts where the jueza Lucy Billings demarches a agenda to prohibía the evacuation forzosa of place and she is the demonstrators to extra acampados.
Moreover the &apos; indignados &apos; procedieron to the occupation of a new park nearing in the confluencia the rules céntricas Channel Journal and the Sexta Avenida very closely the first to tunnel Holland that unite New York and New Jersey and property of the mass of Trinity Church.
At least during a hour overpower occupy the place but then the Police turned and 17,900 to stop to some of the demonstrators although Bray not could confirm the figure concrete while assured to Efe that when the several journalists that were also esposados.
The organisation ensures that are several hundreds of people the that is previously installed in this point where already been has desplazado a delegation of leaders religious in shows the support to the treaty of movement and the has treaty of mediar with the Police.
Among therefore the square Zuccotti don is a recinto the property privada- continues doors to the expected to the wise the one eye judiciary shortly for this same Tuesday in the that is how analyse the legality of the evacuation of this brave.
Some the demonstrators IDPs until there portaban and repartían to these hours copies of this agenda judiciary and even the entregaban to the players to custodiaban the square what is set &apos; some small clashes &apos; pursued Bray cast Bossi that some official propinaron coups to the demonstrators.
The agenda judiciary prohibe to the authorities desalojar to the members of Ocupa Wall Journal or implement &apos; laws that is publicaron later the that mismanage the occupation or ban to the demonstrators access to new the volume with shops or other properties that using previously &apos;.
The Mayor Bloomberg pursued foremost the press that because the this agenda judiciary the city had suspended the reapertura of space the public and to the demonstrators to the that alerted without however that the laws local not they Youth liable to establish with shops the campaign and sacks of taking.
The regidor coccidiostats personally the desalojo led to all the following the square Zuccotti a operation in the that is 17,900 to make the latest and the are decided because the demonstrators were &apos; violations the law &apos;.
Bloomberg mover that only the agenda of evacuar the square because one is was becoming &apos; in a place in the that the people not venÍan to protest but to violate the laws and in some cases to do harm to other people &apos; already the &apos; some business habÍan received threats &apos; and the neighbours temÍan &apos; for their quality of life &apos;.
&apos; The desalojo the this brave was asqueroso and demonstrates that the fund Bloomberg is more interested in preserving the interests financial that the workers American &apos; added the spokesman the movement cast unauthorised the mayor of &apos; faltar the respect to the freedom of expression &apos;.
The responsible the &apos; Ocupa Wall Journal &apos; indicaron also the considerably organise &apos; large actions &apos; for the Thursday in cooperation with organisations All and trade for commemorate the two months to gall the protests that fossil the September.

Japan renace after the earthquake.
The GDP growth a % thanks to consumption calls and puts end to the spiral of caídas that whereas in March.
Since the past month of March the economy Japanese is bringing paralizada still convaleciente for the devastating earthquake that devino in a crisis nuclear the worst disaster that padeció the country nipón since the II War World.
The initial estimates of government of Tokio cifraron the losses materials in million of dollars a coup that despite the difficult context global seems been atenuado.
After the three quarters consecutivos the caídas the central of Producto Interior Bruto between July and September constructive for pass web definitive the GDP is incrementó a % in comparison with the accelerator previous and a % in rate anualizada.
The recorded in the second accelerator for the Japanese the year fiscal begins in March the - it addition the main pace of growth since the period of January to March the ..
The recovery is explains in part for the repunte the purchasing the machinery for restored the areas asoladas for the seísmo and the front tsunami.
Indeed fact the companies statistic their investments in a % cope the declining of % in expenses the capital to being observed the January to March the first abandoned later the six months of startling ininterrumpidas.
However the real revulsivo the economy Japanese not been founded exclusively in the momentum non-Keynesian that taught to exploit the crisis for strengthen or rebuild the infrastructure servirse the rules shortcomings for grow since zero.
Japan has reawakened on all thanks to the growth of consumption calls the in the date represents the % of GDP japonés.
This finds escaló a % empujada for the increase the expenditure in vehicles travel and activities of leisure.
The stigma of yen.
Tokio is the encomendado the market internal when the yen the currency nipona is the become the one of the &apos; values refuge &apos; escogidos for the investors to fear of the crisis the debt in the area euro and the shady forecasts of US a privileged to overvalued as a losa in the accounts in the companies exportadoras.
With a motto more strong the products findings more expensive in the abroad a serious reverse for a country whose online the flotación economic next closures for the health of the large groups ITC.
Toyota or Sony for example achacaron their weak results between July and September to the prices of yen.
Meanwhile the markets continuing with their asedio to the countries inner-city the EU the government of Yoshihiko Noda not low the on-call.
&apos; There that be vigilant to the risks that standards as the deterioration of a economies foreign the impact of the floods in Thailand and the fast opinion of yen &apos; pointed yesterday the secretary of state of policy Recovery Motohisa Furukawa.
And in effect the prospects not findings encouraging.
The Organisation for the Cooperation and the Development Economic OECD precisó that the majority of the countries Member tabled in September signs more nítidos the threat economic.
The indicator that anticipa the points of ancient in the economy global commissions the interface that the main powers is are frenando.
already that struggle four décimas until the points cope to the August.
The zone euro even been situó for below the average is being position in the level , the precipitarse eight décimas until the points.
Athens again to herbivores the doubts.
Papadimos says that is aprobarán the adjustments but the conservative not firmarán circumstances compromise writing.
With the premiums the risk peripheral disparadas and the uncertainty reinstalada in the parqués Greece continues enredando in the laberinto that leads towards the exit the great crisis the debt European.
The feeling of the &apos; consensus &apos; of new Government the transition heleno next more imposed by the demands of Brussels that we a right-of-centre convincing the rules forces policies begins to permanently with facts.
Meanwhile the new first minister Lukas Papadimos advertía yesterday that not there alternative to the reforms structural and the period of one day agreed in its designation perhaps is hanging short for implement the leader of party Conservative New Democracy Antonis Samaras aseguraba that not respaldará new measures to austerity in circumstances case and reiteró his demand the new elections to the date shortly the February.
&apos; The main task of this Government is enforcing the decisions of the summit of the October &apos; aseveró Papadimos the opening yesterday a debate parliamentary that hope morning with a vote in confidence to new Executive.
A package with programmes for speed the employment the reform of code refunded the officials and new measures against the tax fiscal vision the first initiatives.
However the message of Samaras not despeja the doubts about their position &apos; We have committed to help the government of transition but not we have committed to nothing more &apos;.
The leader Conservative was a pasito more far the his pulso to the EU and the IMF the bodies to must desbloquear the millions to Athens needs to urgent and showed clear that not move their seen good to none letter of compromise the compliance the adjustments.
But the Commission European escocida still for the impact lie for the órdago of referendum the Papandreu reiteró yesterday that his demand is clear not desbloqueará the aid if the new Government and the leaders of the main parties helenos not firman &apos; a compromise writing without ambiguity and we before possible &apos;.
The spokesman the Affairs vice-chairman Amadeu Altafaj mover that the inspectors of the Kinshasa regresarán &apos; very soon &apos; to Athens for afterglow with the new Government &apos; what is being given to pay the sixth pre-financing &apos; the millions although either there date final.
The madeja Greek still has balance for pink.
Doña Sofia &apos; are instruments for the progress and the hope &apos;.
The Reina emphasised the place &apos; preponderante &apos; the Spain in relationship to this type of finance.

The Reina Doña Sofia reminded yesterday that the country is the become the these two latest decades in the second donor of begs in relationship to this intrumento the cooperation whose &apos; essence &apos; pointed that assurance in a &apos; instrument for the progress social the justice and the hope of a future best for all the humanity target-based in the confidence in the be human &apos;.
The Reina supposedly yesterday the Greens Summit World of Microcrédito in Valladolid with the convincing the that &apos; not there doubt &apos; the that she type of operations are &apos; absolutely viable &apos; for achieving the Millennium of Millennium schedules for Nations UN with horizon and &apos; very particularly in all the reason as goal the reduction to the half of volume of people to live with income ashamed to a dolar daily , with the that is scorning the &apos; threshold of poverty &apos;.
Spain &apos; continues working &apos; for broadened the network of beneficiaries &apos; to all the corners of planet and helping this task with &apos; responsibility &apos; pointed Doña Sofia that expectation that the initiatives and contributions to being originen in the Summit that is prolongará until the Thursday &apos; Retailers the creation of new capacities and best opportunities for the most poor and on all for the women &apos; main charity the state loans.
are &apos; many the achievements infrastructural &apos; and &apos; many the challenges to the that we facing &apos;.
The Summit of Microcrédito is proposed not only as a forum the debate but also like to platform since the that speed &apos; two metas Chad &apos;.
So Their Majestad mover that is ambition to the to end of that the millions of families poor that around accedido to these services financial and the one million of these homes wealth-creators of threshold of poverty in the that are ragamuffin.
The momentum in the view of the microcréditos in Spain and in the rest of world &apos; has followed the path generated ago years of working forerunners &apos; for Muhammad Yunus resalto Doña Sofia as a &apos; act of justice and recognition due &apos;.
And is that described the father of this tool as a &apos; idealistic admirable in the cause universal the fight against the poverty &apos; whose work knows since ago years when the Reina boarding to Bangladesh for fortunate on the ground his policy of loans.
To this experience him trialogues a year more afternoon the first Summit World in Washington and other events as the celebrados in Côte the Côte in Canada and &apos; in all have shown conservatives the progress evolution &apos; , mover Their Majestad , whose link with this project him sway yesterday the calificativo the &apos; head of family &apos; congregada in Valladolid for part of &apos; baquero the poor &apos;.

Campeón the Europe in the sector eólico of opened Does the % of their electricity also a one of the large users of coal and the gas due to the intermitencia of wind for this reason their emissions the CO2 and the price of their electricity are respectively a % and a % more highest that the average European.
For the contrary thanks to the troubles of our policy energy our neighbours abonan a bill the electricity a % higher to the homes French.
Meanwhile that the one economy restructurings the cost of the energy represents a factor key to the competitiveness and a guarantee of peacekeeping the usefulness industrial in the territory national the companies French is Ninety the electricity more cheap the Europe.
For that was any reduction significantly the energy nuclear eye a strong efficiently of price of the electricity what is restaría realism to the maravillosas statements on the reindustrialización the group country and the defence of our power purchasing.
They talking to a price is the great majority of the French is refuse to pay and the fact not manifiestan opposition for principle to that type of energy according keen to polls.

If France decidiese leave the energy nuclear eye to sacrificio the great part of those SMEs and the loss of the millions of euros annual in exports French the equipment and services nuclear.
What electricista encargaría a EPR designed to work Sixty years when is scheduled the collapse of their manufacturer.
For deal of equation the energy nuclear there is admit that not exist a source miracle the production of electricity the Like that either exists a source diabólica.
The development for part of Areva the solutions with lowest emissions the CO2 nuclear and renewable shows the nature complement the rules sources of energy.
In the case of the energy nuclear is essential maintain the maximum level of safety.
In France comes to a Authority the safety that hierocracy a control narrower and transparent therefore on the central existing as on the construction of Flamanville.
Our teams the recognised professionalism are also obsessed for the safety.
In half century the sector nuclear has suffered three accidents serious.
Only each of the Three Mile Island is in the should conditions operational normal not Enquiry consequences nor for the people or for the environment.
In Chernobyl the accident is due to design of overheated and to few failings human imperdonables.
In Fukushima some people are forget that the accident is due to two disasters natural the one reach without unprecedented that wave the death of tens of thousands of people.
The sector nuclear aprenderá the issue accident stand as we did the two previous.
Thank to these progress and to a cooperation between the authorities of safety and the operators and builders French and Germans the EPR where a design capable of resistir to such phenomena.

The immigration So a burden or a opportunity to the economy.
The policy of immigration roundly for Nicolas Sarkozy has been criticada plainly since various points of view the saturación the services police judicial and administrative dominated to the political the figures the compatibility of this policy with the status autoproclamado the &apos; country of the rights human &apos; the France.
Over recently is the harassment administrative the students foreign the that has saltado to the headlines with the Minister the Interior véase the newspaper Libération of the May proclamando the past that France &apos; not need talentos foreign adequately nor camareros &apos;.
However rarely increasingly being analysing since the point of view economic.
The issue is that on this issue is quite consensus between the Geremek and the sense.
In the case of the sense Jacques Chirac fijó the prospect declarando in the &apos; unemployed not Libraries be a problem for a country to account of close to two million of workers immigrants &apos; while the in the Geremek the discern what fijó Michel Rocard explicando that France &apos; not be unaware office of all the misery of world &apos; in ..
The unique difference the rise to generosity.
In , therefore the Geremek as the sense compartían the fear to the invasion of territory national for a Cities the fontaneros Poles.
To two ends is viewed that the immigrants are a burden for the economy and the society French.
The unique difference is in the rise to generosity with the that type with regard to the immigrants.
In his programme Vichy Hollande is limited to include banalidades indicating that the codesarrollo permit deal of &apos; problem of the migration &apos;.
This idea of the immigration as a burden a problem perhaps is covered electoralmente but economically its very pack.
Perhaps as guarding the economists Ian Goldin and Geoffrey Cameron in a masterpiece recent that sums the knowledge more Recent on the immigration Exceptional People How Migration Shaped Our World loosening Will Define Our Future May the Princeton University Associated 352 pp ) there a broader consensus between the specialists on the impact positive the flows migratory in the growth economic , the wages and the employment in the countries that receive immigrants.
The life-threatening the immigration distorts the growth and harm the employment.
The fears questions with the impact of the immigrants are based in the idea of the state can replace to the workers national in particular to the little qualified pressing for the are reduce their wages.
But the experience shows that the reality the immigrants are more well credit to substitutes the workers national and ensured mainly professions in sectors with lack of employment.
The immigrants little qualified employed in sectors that not warlords to workers national and the most qualified in sectors dynamic where the training not request the demand the staff.
A effect positive on the wages.
From same manner that a Perisic doing difficulties for work in a country to purchase lack of anestesistas the complementariedad between national and immigrants causing that the arrival of these past invest For in the wages and the employment of the national.
Bearing in mind what previous Giovanni Peri calculó that a increase the % of the flows migratory supposed to tackling the wages real to long-term term of between a and a %.
And without having to account the fact the that the diversity is aportan the immigrants helps to the creation of ideas and the growth economic exists a great proportion of awarding Nobel American naturalizados and companies as Google Intel Paypal eBay and Yahoo were well-founded for immigrants ..
The immigrants also the taxpayers dig to the systems social project that aportan the average a % of budget total in the countries Europeans.
The Organisation International of unemployment estimated for example the in Germany a immigrant that comes to a age of years operators a much neta income least expenses the euro to the budgets public to average during across his life.
At principle of their mandate Nicolas Sarkozy wanted go to seek the points of growth is you faltaban &apos; with the tooth &apos;.
PAN tooth that disuadieron to the immigrants resulted exactly the effect Salem.
Europe invented the democracy only him lack thinking in a democracy European.
The democracy is a good precious but also fragile.
The continent European should power acordarse the this already the although is invented in Athens ago more of two thousand years to what long-term of century 20th has suffered the tragedies of the War World totalitarismos the Holocaust the roots but also to Franco in Spain to Salazar in Portugal the coroneles in Greece.
Some perhaps believed that is that the democracy triunfase definitive on their enemies would enough exercise the vote and the manner more direct possible.

The suffrage universal although is about the one condition necessary to the democracy not a sufficient for itself only and even can norm in a &apos; instrument of oppression &apos; as truthfully vis the filósofo republicano Etienne Vacherot.
not the democracy required much more a space public a spirit public values a organisation a separation and a control of the powers a education Luces solidarity economic and social justice.
The crisis that live in Europe is a crisis economic but is to point of norm in a crisis policy and democratic.
The palinodia of referendum Greek verdadero-falso had to this regard a dual effect demonstrates daring the need to a return potent the agricultural policy but also the concern feeling of their Alternatively the his inconsistency.
must reflexionarse on this ambivalence for superarla.
The truth is that the lines of cope the battle democratic currently being have desplazado and the in many cases the soldiers Republican already not progressive in the good sense.
not saldremos gaining if asked a catalogue of referenda national problematic in function of the requirements and the way desordenada.
A signing in white the monarca European absolute or a high the gap of hole nacionalista generalized what options for the citizen.
not want cash coups the effect but a exercise common in full right relaxed and continuous the rules options and the democracy this time to scale European.
not there crisis in Greece Italy Spain Portugal the fact not sabríamos where overcome the list because only there is crisis , the crisis the Europe.
The undiscovered the Europe is the that is pliega to the orders of the markets and the rules agencies the rating that the that unaccompanied his Powerlessness and their lack of solidarity.

The Nord Stream new door of entry of gas Russian in Europe.
The pipeline Nord Stream that comunica directly Europe Western with Russia happening for the fund of Sea Baltic already been has now in service.
must supply gas for satisfy the requirements of thirty million of homes.
Gazprom the giant Russian of gas has to hold the event with great pompa.
The past Tuesday more of guests including four Heads the state and the government participated to banks of Baltic between the music the orquesta and a delicate bufet in the opening of Nord Stream the new pipeline that comunica directly under the sea Russia with Germany.
Simbólicamente the Chancellor German Angela the President Russian Dmitri Medvedev the Prime Minister French Vichy Fillon and their counterpart the Netherlands Mark Rutte have girado together the volante the válvula that controls the first of gas Russian in the network of Europe Western.
With this new pipeline each year audience million of metres cubic the gas Russian additional to Europe Western to via the one first had the km that comunican the region of St Petersburg with the Land the Mecklemburgo-Pomerania.
A Secondly tubo should concluirse to end of the view supply a total of millions of metres cubic the gas is say enough to get everything the consumption French.
Moreover already been talks the possibility of building a third tubo for the same pack.
For Gazprom the completion to time to this issue masterpiece where aires the victory.
Poland and the countries Baltic is previously conflicting definite the project.
Indeed fact the Nord Stream goes to allow supply gas directly to Germany avoid the During penetrate for third-country countries Poland and Ukraine ..
Indeed coup these two countries and we in its power to them will more difficult influence in Russia amenazándola with cerrarle the access to the markets of Europe Western.
In the point álgido of debate Warsaw not dudó in three the Nord Stream as a &apos; new pact germano-soviético &apos; in reference to the alliance between Hitler and Stalin for occupy Poland in ..
It say if the issue is politically delicate.
Europe Western continue to project Russian has Resources a greater security of supply.
But the price is a weakening of the Europe the energy prioritised that the project has insatiable a healed between the Europeans of this and the west.
Russia has Ali in that only five years do triunfar his vision of a alliance direct between Russia and the countries Western rich large consumers the gas and with each reserves each time more limited.
&apos; This pipeline represents a component of our partnership with Russia a new arteria that we unite the way conventional &apos; confirmed Vichy Fillon during the opening of pipeline demonstrating until what point the large contracts of sector of gas are very politicians as economic.
All this explains the broad smiles in the faces a the securities the Gazprom numerous in Lubmin in the point of arrival of gas.
The construction of this pipeline also supposed a achievement technical.
The tubo submarino is Made the steel recubierto the cement for protegerlo against the anclas the ships.

&apos; In case of avería interrumpiremos the step of gas in less the one minute &apos; organization Jens Müller.
In case of flight the gas of pipeline is liberará for both to the atmosphere.
But the seating publicity little likely to being occurs a brain project that have scheduled junturas that according to forecasts appeal a brain each years.
The control of state of pipeline is absolutely prohibited a starting submarino arrastrado for a vessel that responsibilities inspections external case as prohibited a recording that freely for the internal of pipeline.

The pipeline has been designed to work for fifty years without need to circumstances type of reparación.
The movement of gas is absolutely simply for the pressure.
At principle is the bars and to the exit the bars.
Five companies have joined their forces to power wear to all this project.
The company leader is Gazprom that has the % of the cautiously.
To her is unieron the German E.ON and BASF 15,5 each a , case as the reporting Gasunie and the group French GDF Suez 9 each one ..
These five societies have created a company common so-called Nord Stream charge of building and exploiting the pipeline.

After Gazprom alquiló to start society during a long the sample years renewable the methodology the rules in the transport the gas.
&apos; To Gazprom him BMI for the capacity total regardless of the amount of gas that really is transport &apos; organization Jens Müller.
The funding of the construction of pipeline is the a correct in a % of the point of the accionistas and in a % prohibited loans Serious.
The cost total of the rights should achieve million of euros for the two tubos.
For GDF Suez for example the investment has reached the millions.
But the accionistas weaker are insurance the that not superarán his investment project that Gazprom moderating for itself only the risk of the costs.
The pipeline emerge of Baltic in Lubmin in a coast arenosa plantada the pinos.
Good válvulas with metres of speaking form the door of an of gas.
exist few sensors that miden the pressure the temperature and the characteristics reliant of gas to the arrival before the that is owed to the pipelines Germans.

But there a party that play and a trading Bosnia that defeat.
Bearing in mind the party the ida 0-0 the Friday in the hell of Zenica , seems obvious that the thing not is proactive.
